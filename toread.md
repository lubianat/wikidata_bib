Kim, J. J. & Rebholz-Schuhmann, D. Categorization of services for seeking information in biomedical literature: a typology for improvement of practice. Brief. Bioinformat. 9, 452–465 (2008). This manuscript exploits assumptions and observations linked to search behaviour from users of Web pages to judge the information-seeking behaviour of scientists. It judges available text-mining tools according to these assumptions.

This article explores how authors report on their results and how the collection of reported facts can be traced, compared and evaluated against each other. It gives early indications of what results might be produced if we applied automatic reasoning to the information from scientific literature and other resources.

Rzhetsky, A., Seringhaus, M. & Gerstein, M. Seeking a new biology through text mining. Cell 134, 9–13 (2008). The authors argue that the exploitation of the scientific literature will serve as an additional resource for the generation of hypotheses and the validation of human- driven hypotheses
