# Highlights

We identify seven fibroblast subsets with distinct surface protein phenotypes, and collapse them into three subsets by integrating transcriptomic data. One fibroblast subset, characterized by the expression of proteins podoplanin, THY1 membrane glycoprotein and cadherin-11, but lacking CD34, is threefold expanded in patients with RA relative to patients with osteoarthritis

We first examined freshly isolated synovial fibroblasts for protein expression of a variety of surface markers that have been reported to be expressed on fibroblasts

 Remarkably, unbiased subsets (defined by hierarchical clustering of single cells with 23 genes that show high mean and variance across cells) were concordant with the three subsets defined by protein levels of CD34 and THY1 surface markers (P < 10−4; Permutation test) (Fig. 2a, b).

 Since fibroblast identity is highly dependent on the microenvironment, we sought to determine whether anatomical localization of fibroblast subsets could contribute to transcriptomic heterogeneity in OA and RA synovial tissue (Fig. 3a, b, and Supplementary Fig. 6). I
