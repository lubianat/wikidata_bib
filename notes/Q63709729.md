# Highlights
Knowledge graphs (KGs) are multi-relational, directed graphs in which nodes represent entities and edges represent
their relations (Bordes et al. 2013). While they have been successfully applied for question answering, information
extraction, and named entity disambiguation outside of the biomedical domain, their usage in biomedical
applications remains limited (Malone et al. 2018; Nickel et al., 2016).

Because of the heterogeneity and lack of structure in most
biological and clinical data, we aim to implement additional KGE models that incorporate text, logical rules, and
images in addition to the triples in a knowledge graph (Wang et al., 2017; Hamilton et al. 2018). Further, modeling
multiscale biology (i.e., the -omics, biological process, phenotype, and population levels) results in KGs with a
variety of compositions, structural features, and topologies for which different KGE models are most appropriate
