# Highlights

Sir
Three cheers for Michael O'Donnell (Feb 5, p 489).1 Medical journals are frequently dull and are becoming duller mostly as a consequence of touchy-feely text and psychobabble. There are many other causes of their dullness; some are curable and some incurable.2 Unfortunately, as pointed out by O'Donnell, the unhealthy condition of citation seeking is increasing the frequency of dullness. Perhaps the time has come for a little honesty and humility or even rebellion from citation seekers and guest authors when contributing. In the words of Voltaire “II fait avoir perdu le bon sens pour m'attribuer cette coionnerie”, roughly translated as: “you must be out of your mind if you think I wrote this load of *****.”
