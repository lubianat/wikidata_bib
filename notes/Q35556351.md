# Highlights

To understand why cells differ from each other, we need to understand which genes are transcribed at a single-cell level. Several methods measure messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in single cells, but most are limited to relatively low numbers of cells or genes. Fan et al. labeled each mRNA molecule in a cell with both a cellular barcode and a molecular barcode. F

We applied CytoSeq to characterize complex heterogeneous samples in the human hematopoietic system by examining thousands of cells per experiment. In addition to surface proteins that are traditional cell type markers, we examined genes coding for cytokines, transcription factors, and intracellular proteins of various cellular functions that may not be readily accessible by flow cytometry. We demonstrated the ability to identify major subsets within human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

To demonstrate the ability of CytoSeq to identify individual cells among a population of two
cell types, a ~1:1 mixture of K562 (myelogenous
leukemia) and Ramos (Burkittâ€™s lymphoma) cells
was loaded onto a partial array of ~25,000 microwells. A panel of 12 genes was selected and amplified from the cDNA beads and sequenced. The
panel consisted of five genes specific for K562
cells, six genes specific for Ramos cells, and the
common housekeeping gene GAPDH (table S1A).
