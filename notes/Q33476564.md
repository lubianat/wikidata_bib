# Highlights
Here we address the extraction of related genes by searching for densely-connected subgraphs, which are modeled as cliques, in a biomedical relational graph.
or clarifying complex disease mechanisms, obtaining relationships among genes associated with the diseases should be crucial. Comprehensive extraction of related-gene sets by clique-based data mining may provide us with a systematic methodology for gaining insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying various biological phenomena including diseases.
