# Highlights

Our study aims to evaluate the usability of Wikidata as a data source for robots operating on the web of data, according to specifications and practices of linked data, the Semantic Web and ontology reasoning.

We evaluated from the perspective of two use cases of data crawling robots, which are guided by our general motivation
to acquire richer data for Europeana, a data aggregator from the Cultural Heritage domain.

In particular, we evaluate the possibilities for machine ontologybased reasoning on the RDF output of Wikidata, for RDF-crawling processes by robots and for using its data in other general data applications

As we aim at eventually studying the usability
of Wikidata for the Europeana case, we focus on Wikidata resources that correspond
to the Europeana dataset of cultural heritage resources.
The general overview of the study is as follows:
• Cultural heritage objects that are described in both Europeana and Wikidata were
identified. The corresponding subsets were harvested for supporting our study.

In this section, we present the results of the study. It is important to note that the results of our study were gathered and checked for the last time on 12 of April 2019.

The main limiting aspect that blocks an advanced process in the interpretation of the data
is the use of rdf:type9 . It is used just to state that the RDF resource is an Item from the
Wikibase ontology (http://wikiba.se/ontology#Item), and for further types, the property wdt:P31 is used. An advanced application that is able to search in all used properties’ RDF resources, could bypass this limitation and interpret the data, but not in the
case of Wikidata. This impossibility comes from the fact that Wikidata’s RDF resources’ URIs are not resolvable in all cases. In the case of property wdt:P31, it is stated in the data as http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P31, which is not resolvable.

Unfortunately, the semantics of the RDF output of Wikidata is locked-in the usage of predicates from Wikidata’s own ontology,
making them uninterpretable for data crawlers based on of properties for general data
processing that the Semantic Web relies on.
