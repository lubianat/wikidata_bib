# Highlights

The first resource is a terminology
covering heme-specific terms not yet included in standard controlled vocabularies.
Using this terminology, we curated and modeled the second resource, a mechanistic
knowledge graph representing the hemeâ€™s interactome based on a corpus of 46
scientific articles.

Biological knowledge formalized as a network can be used
by clinicians as research and information retrieval tools,
by biologists to propose in vitro and in vivo experiments,
and by bioinformaticians to analyze high throughput -omics
experiments (Catlett et al., 2013; Ali et al., 2019).

The second resource is a heme knowledge graph (HemeKG), that is, a
network comprising more than 700 nodes and more than 3,000
interactions.

Knowledge was manually extracted
and curated from this selected corpus using the official
Biological Expression Language (BEL) curation guidelines
from http://openbel.org/language/version_2.0/bel_specification_
version_2.0.html and http://language.bel.bio as well as additional
guidelines from https://github.com/pharmacome/curation.

We have presented HemeKG, the first mechanistic model in the
context of heme biology, as a viable solution to comprehensively
summarize heme-related processes by bringing knowledge from
disparate literature together.
