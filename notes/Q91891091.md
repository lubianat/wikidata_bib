# Highlights
One identified subpopulation is a unique cell type that expresses adipocyte markers but contains no lipid droplets. As non-proliferative precursors for adipocytes, they exist abundantly as pericytes and stromal cells that form a ubiquitous 3D network inside the marrow cavity. Functionally they play critical roles in maintaining marrow vasculature and suppressing bone formation. Therefore, we name them marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs) and conclude that they are a newly identified component of marrow adipose tissue

In the bone marrow of young Adipoq:Td mice, Perilipin-Td+ cells far exceeded Perilipin+Td+ adipocytes in number. Cell counting in tibial sections revealed approximate 400:1 and 1000:1 ratios of Perilipin-Td+ cells to Perilipin+Td+ in the metaphyseal and diaphyseal bone marrow, respectively (n = 3 mice).
