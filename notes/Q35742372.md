# Highlights

SemMedDB is distributed as a
MySQL relational database, which has some problems when
dealing with network data. We transformed and uploaded
SemMedDB into the Neo4j graph database, and implemented
the basic LBD discovery algorithms with the Cypher query
language. We conclude that storing the data needed for
semantic LBD is more natural in a graph database.

Here we propose the Neo4j graph database as an
alternative for implementing semantic LBD because Neo4j is
particularly useful for storing data structured as a network.

We show here how to implement the LBD discovery pattern
“inhibit the cause of the disease” which can be used to find novel treatments.

In this Cypherquery, phsu, gngm and dsyn are UMLS semantic type
abbreviations; and drug, gene and disease are variables thatare instantiated to particular values when the query is run:
```
MATCH
(drug:phsu) -[:INHIBITS]-> (gene:gngm) -[:CAUSES]-> (disease:dsyn)
WHERE NOT
(drug)-[:TREATS]->(disease)
RETURN drug, gene, disease
```
