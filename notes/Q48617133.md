# Highlights


Although I applaud the ethos of the argument presented, graduate students such as myself often suffer from anonymity in their field of research, even though our work is often at the cutting edge

I suggest that journals consider introducing a 'PhD student peer-review pool' to which students and their supervisors can sign up.

Having recently completed my first review, I believe that it has made me far more objective about my own writing and can only benefit the production of my thesis. I therefore look forward to receiving my next invitation to review.
