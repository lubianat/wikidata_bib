# Highlights
e. Here, we present STAB (a Spatio-Temporal cell Atlas of the human Brain), a database consists of single-cell transcriptomes across multiple brain regions and developmental periods. Right now, STAB contains single-cell gene expression profiling of 42 cell subtypes across 20 brain regions and 11 developmental periods. 

STAB is available at http://stab.comp-sysbio.org.

he Allen Brain Cell Types Database contains single-nucleus sequencing data for middle temporal gyrus (MTG), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and primary visual cortex (V1C) of the adult human brain from 24 to 66 years (27). 

To integrate the 13 scRNA-seq datasets collected above and remove batch effects of multiple datasets, the R package Seurat (v3.0.1


 The interactive browser of individual cell subtypes was accomplished with the UCSC cell browser (https://cells.ucsc.edu). With a user-friendly interactive interface, the users can easily browse and query cell subtypes and their gene expression profiling across brain regions and developmental periods.

e noticed that the majority of our defined cell subtypes were evenly distributed among developmental periods, brain regions and datasets (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5), indicating that the batch effects and bias have been well controlled.
