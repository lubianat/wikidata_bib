# Highlights
This novel visualization system requires the development and integration of automatic functional group discovery, set associations, and linking set associations. Specifically, we perform hierarchical clustering on the potential discoveries generated by an LBD system to create a tree of potential hypotheses.

Linking Set Association: we develop linking set association, which estimates the association between indirectly related sets of terms using the set association of their co-occurring terms. This allows us to estimate the interestingness of functional groups identified in LBD target term lists.

Comprehensive LBD Visualization: we develop a visualization system that combines these contributions to create an interactive user interface in which LBD target term output is displayed.

Algorithm constructs a binary hierarchical cluster tree, for which each target term is a leaf node, and the root is a cluster containing all target terms

An example of hierarchical clustering, in which the root node is all supplements, single terms are leaf nodes and are indicated by asterisks.

--> Not really a product of the algorith "hierarchical clustering" but simply a taxonomic tree
