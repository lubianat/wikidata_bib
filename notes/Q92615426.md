# Highlights

We show that seqFISH+ can image mRNAs for 10,000 genes in single cells—with high accuracy and sub-diffraction-limit resolution

 This technology demonstrates the ability to generate spatial cell atlases and to perform discovery-driven studies of biological processes in situ.

 Here we demonstrate seqFISH+, which achieves super-resolution imaging and multiplexing of 10,000 genes in a single cell using sequential hybridizations and imaging with a standard confocal microscope. 

, Approximately 47,000 mRNAs (coloured dots) were identified in a NIH/3T3 cell from a single z-section (scale bar,  10 μm). Inset shows the transcripts decoded in cell protrusions (n = 227 cells; scale bar,  100 nm).

 In the granule cell layer (GCL) at the centre of the olfactory bulb, several cell classes are observed, with an interior core consisting of immature neuroblast-like cells expressing Dlx1 and Dlx2, encased by a distinct outer layer of the GCL comprising more mature interneurons
