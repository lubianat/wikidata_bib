# Highlights
Here, we reconstruct gene expression
trajectories specifying INs generated throughout the neurogenic period in macaques
and mice by analysing the transcriptomes of 250,181 cells

Second, we find
that multiple classes of transcriptionally conserved olfactory bulb (OB)-bound
precursors are redirected to expanded primate white matter and striatum. These
classes include a novel peristriatal class of striatum laureatum neurons that resemble
dopaminergic periglomerular cells of the OB.


We focused on the lateral, medial and
caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE, MGE and CGE, respectively) and
ventromedial forebrain (VMF) regions including the septum, preoptic
area and preoptic hypothalamus, where distinct configurations of
transcription factors specify initial IN classes


The widespread distribution and diversity of derivatives from some
initial classes such as MGE_LHX6/NPY also highlights the shared genetic
programmes underlying the initial specification of populations that
later diversify according to regional destinations, where terminal
classes are commonly subdivided into many transcription types and
morphotypes.
