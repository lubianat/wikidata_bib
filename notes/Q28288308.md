# Highlights

Barend Mons's first objective would be ambitious enough for most people: to meld some of the most important biomedical databases into a single information resource. 
But that's just the beginning. Mons, a bioinformatician at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, also wants to apply the Wikipedia philosophy. 
He's inviting the whole research community to help update a vast store of interlinked data. If he and his colleagues can pull it off — and even the project's advocates are not sure they can — they could transform the databases that are central to the work of many life scientists

--> That was right before Wikidata! 

That's an attractive proposition, say database administrators. Michael Ashburner, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, UK, helps run FlyBase, a collection of gene data on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster

The database receives around US$4 million a year from the US National Institutes of Health and employs up to five full-time curators, but still can't keep up with the relevant literature, says Ashburner.

“Mons is a visionary,” says Amos Bairoch at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Geneva, a collaborator on the project and the creator of Swiss-Prot. “This will be a revolution.”j
