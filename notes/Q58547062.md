# Highlights
Single-cell RNA-seq reveals distinct CD45+ cells associated
with clinical outcome

Two distinct states of CD8+
T cells were defined by clustering and associated
with patient tumor regression or progression. A
single transcription factor, TCF7, was visualized
within CD8+ T cells in fixed tumor samples and predicted positive clinical outcome in an independent
cohort of checkpoint-treated patients.

study, with cells colored based on two clusters
found by k-means clustering.

). CD8_2 cells expressed
many of the same exhaustion markers along with heat shock
proteins (HSPB1, HSPA1A, and HSPA4) and additional inhibitory
receptors (ENTPD1 and KIR2DL4). CD8_3 cells expressed the
known exhaustion markers (HAVCR2, CD38, PDCD1, and
PTPN6) but lacked heat shock and cell-cycle genes. CD8_4

last common ancestor.
