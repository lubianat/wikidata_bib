================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q56697993]  
  
Publication date : 19 of November, 2009  

# Highlights

The world’s most valued plant
database faces extinction
because its funding is being
phased out by the US National
Science Foundation (NSF), and
no alternative source is on the
horizon.

--> Luckly it seems to still be active :) https://www.arabidopsis.org/

Further recommendations
on a prototype Japanese–European fusion reactor, planned as part of the international ITER
project to prove atomic fusion as a power
source, were expected as Nature went to press.
