# Highlights
The Plant Ontology (PO) is a community resource consisting of standardized terms,
definitions, and logical relations describing plant structures and development stages,
augmented by a large database of annotations from genomic and phenomic studies

The PO and its annotation database (http://www.planteome.
org) make plant data for any species more discoverable and accessible through
common formats, thus providing support for applications in plant pathology, image
analysis, and comparative development and evolution.

The PO is divided into two major branches rooted in the terms
plant anatomical entity 2 and plant structure development stage.
The former branch was described in detail in Cooper et al. (2013).
We focus here on the plant structure development stage branch
and associated data.

The PO terms are defined using the Aristotelian or genus-
differentia format: An A is a B which Cs (Rosse and Mejino,
2003; Arp et al., 2015)


Occurrence of a developmental process from the Gene
Ontology (GO), e.g., the sporophyte senescent stage is defined
as sporophyte development stage during which a plant is
undergoing GO: multicellular organism senescence.

We chose to define the vegetative, reproductive, and senescent
stages as occurring sequentially. Under this representation,
a sporophyte reproductive stage occurs during the interval between
the initiation of a sporangium and the onset of senescence. Once a
plant produces a single sporangium, it remains in the sporophyte
reproductive stage until it begins to senesce and does not cycle
back and forth between a sporophyte reproductive stage and a
sporophyte vegetative stage, even though an iteroparous plant may
well cycle back and forth between reproductive and vegetative
growth.
