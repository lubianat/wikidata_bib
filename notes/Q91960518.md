# Highlights
(A) Phylogenetic tree based on the NCBI taxonomy of animals used in this study (generated via https://phylot.biobyte.de/). M

--> Nice, many species. Maybe interesting for - 2.4.4.2.2 The sensu stricto cell type

Here we comprehensively characterize the conservation and
divergence of the microglia program across evolution. By
comparing microglia gene expression across species, we
identify a conserved microglia core program in all mammals.
Single-cell analysis showed that most mammalian microglia
display one primary transcriptional state without any other
apparent subtypes. 

--> Also for - 2.4.4.2.1 The cell archetype

Microglia genes that have been linked
previously to the homeostatic gene
signature of microglia are both highly expressed and conserved in all species, including C1qc, P2ry12,
and Tardbp

The human microglia heterogeneity identified was in sharp contrast to mouse (Figure 4C),
macaque (Figure S5A), marmoset (Figure S5B), hamster (Figure S5C), and sheep (Figure S5D)

Metabolic and Immune Pathways
In order to better understand the conservation of genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases, we have expanded our
single-cell analysis to include two additional rodent models, the
rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the long-lived blind mole rat (BMR,
Spalax ehrenbergi; reported life span of over 20 years)

n summary, our
analysis identifies marked evolution in the expression of multiple
microglia pathways involved in metabolic, complement, and
phagocytic pathways, with many of these pathways implicated
in neurodegenerative diseases.
