# Highlights
The AtlasT4SS is a manual curated database that describes a large number of proteins related to
the type IV secretion system reported so far in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as in Archaea.
The database was created using the RDBMS MySQL and the Catalyst Framework based in the Perl programming
language and using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for Web.

In order to integrate the knowledge about Type IV
Secretion Systems into a selected collection of curated
data, we developed a comprehensive database that currently holds 134 ortholog clusters, totaling 1,617 predicted proteins, encoding the T4SS proteins organized in
a hierarchical classification. This curated data collection
is called AtlasT4SS - the first public database devoted
exclusively to this type of prokaryotic secretion system.



The â€œ1st category": We defined the first category
according to the four well-known T4SS groups, as follows: (i) the F-T4SS group displays the Tra/Trb orthologs that form the conjugal transfer system encoded
on the plasmid F identified in the E. coli genome; (ii) the
P-T4SS group includes the Tra/Trb proteins that are
encoded on the plasmids belonging to the incompatibility group IncP.

 (iii) the I-T4SS group includes ortholog clusters related to the archetypal L. pneumophila, C. burnetti
and/or Plasmid Colb-P9 Dot/Icm systems; and 

(iv) the GI-T4SS group contains orthologs encoded on the
genomic islands of H. influenza, P. aeruginosa and
Salmonella enterica.
