# Highlights

Currently, there is a considerable amount of information about these proteins, but the data are scattered through the literature and in several bioinformatic databases. The database presented here, CTdatabase (http://www.cta.lncc.br), unifies this knowledge to facilitate both the mining of the existing deluge of data, and the identification of proteins alleged to be CT antigens, but that do not have their characteristic restricted expression pattern.

A list of CT antigens was first compiled manually from the literature (see references used to compile the list at http://www.cta.lncc.br, under the link ‘Gene annotations’ in the main page). Computational prediction was also used. The resultant CTdatabase comprises 204 genes.

Three different sources of data were utilized: Serial Analysis of Gene Expression [SAGE, (12)], Massive Parallel Signature Sequencing [MPSS, (13)] and Expressed Sequence Tags [EST, (14)].
