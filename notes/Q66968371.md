# Highlights
hile numerous existing methods focus on the integration of
heterogeneous data to propose candidate drugs, it is still challenging to substantiate
their results with mechanistic insights of these candidate drugs. Therefore, there is a1q1
need for more innovative and efficient methods which can enable better integration
of data and knowledge for drug repositioning.


Here, we present a customizable workflow (PS4DR) which not only
integrates high-throughput data such as genome-wide association study (GWAS)
data and gene expression signatures from disease and drug perturbations but also
takes pathway knowledge into consideration to predict drug candidates for
repositioning.

As a first application, we explored the list of 26 diseases for which our workflow pre-
dicted drug repositioning candidates.

Finally, LINCS compound identi-
fiers were mapped to PubChem compound identifiers using the mapping table
provided by the Ma’ayan Laboratory (http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/static/hdfs/har
monizome/data/lincscmapchemical/gene_attribute_edges.txt.gz) and then from
PubChem compound identifiers to ChEMBL identifiers using UniChem’s RESTful
API [92].
