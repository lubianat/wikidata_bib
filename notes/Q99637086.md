# Highlights
Alternatively, innate or innate-like
T cells developmentally acquire a memory phenotype in the
thymus expressing PLZF (encoded by Zbtb16), which reciprocally
regulate the development of Eomes-expressing bystander memory
T cells by secreting IL-4

iNKT and MAIT cells have canonical TCRVα/Jα and biased
usage of TCRVβ chains that recognize glycolipid or vitamin
metabolites via CD1d and MR1, respectively 4–6 . The development
of iNKT cells occurs via the lineage differentiation model, in
which NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17 cells all develop from common
progenitors 7–

In this study, using the same combination of tran-
scription factors, we deﬁned the analogous effector subsets in
MAIT cells, designated as MAIT1, MAIT2, and MAIT17, and in
γδ T cells, designated as Tγδ1, Tγδ2, and Tγδ17 cells (Fig. 1a).

n this report, we simultaneously analyze all three types of
innate T cells to understand their developmental landscape at the
clonal level using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) paired
with TCR clonotyping analysis in the same cell.


In addition, we analyzed CD24 hi PLZF –
RORγt + γδ T cells as immature Tγδ17 (Tγδ17i) cells, which were
equivalent to CD24 hi Vγ4 + or Vγ6 + γδ T cells (nomenclature of
Heilig & Tonegawa 21 ) 1
