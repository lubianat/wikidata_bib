# Highlights
Single cell RNA sequencing of splenocytes and experiments in genetically-immunodeﬁcient mice reveal the
importance of both T and B cell populations in the anti-inﬂammatory pathway. These ﬁndings
demonstrate the potential for US stimulation of the spleen to treat inﬂammatory diseases.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been
shown to reduce in vivo cytokine production during endotoxemia
in rat and mouse models, including a signiﬁcant reduction of
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and other
inﬂammatory cytokines.


Recent reports demonstrated that noninvasive US energy deliv-
ered to the abdomen of mice diminished inﬂammation and tissue
damage during renal ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI)


Splenocyte transfer studies indicated that the
leukocytes harvested from US-treated spleens could confer protec-
tion from IRI when injected into naïve recipient mice 12 .

As described in the Introduction, previous studies have proposed
that splenic T and B cells contribute to the anti-inﬂammatory
effects induced by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve or by
US stimulation of the spleen 1–12 .
