# Highlights


Here, to measure the epimutation rate at single-cell resolution, we 
applied multiplexed single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite 
sequencing to B cells from healthy donors and patients with CLL.

e greater proliferative histo-
ries in CLL were reflected in increased accumulation of epimutation 
resulting in higher patristic distances (that is, the sum of the lengths 
of branches that link two tips in a tree

Collectively, by leveraging the heritable information captured by 
epimutation, we have retraced the evolutionary histories of CLL and 
charted its evolution after therapy, demonstrating how different line-
ages may be preferentially affected by a therapeutic intervention, even 
in the absence of genetic subclonal drivers.
