# Highlights

BioLit is a web server which provides metadata describing the semantic content of all open access, peer-reviewed articles which describe research from the major life sciences literature archive, PubMed Central.

--> Nice! 2008! - - 1.1.1. Literature Based Discovery, hidden knowledge and text-mining
 and 1.1.3. Interoperable publication processes: nanopublications 


This resource aims to integrate the traditional scientific publication directly into existing biological databases, thus obviating the need for a user to search in multiple locations for information relating to a specific item of interest, for example published experimental results associated with a particular biological database entry

We expect that the community of life scientists in general will be the primary end-users of the web-based viewer, while biocurators will make use of the metadata-containing XML files and the BioLit database of article data. BioLit is available at http://biolit.ucsd.edu .


Yet integration with literature, which is unquestionably the primary medium through which scientists communicate their research, is conspicuously lacking.

BioLit aims to take advantage of the opportunities offered by open access literature by making it possible to include full text or excerpts of these articles directly within existing biological databases and to add newly generated metadata to the articles in order to increase their informative value, tasks which are both made possible by having free access to the full text of the article.

We recognize that we are not experts in natural language processing and that the markup we provide is not truly semantic in nature (e.g. we do not infer relationships between terms and identifiers). We are open to collaboration in order to include this information in future versions.
