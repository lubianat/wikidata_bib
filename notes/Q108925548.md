# Highlights
. In the present paper I shall first summarize Popper’s criticism of the traditional
method of definition, and then go on to comment critically on his own views on the form
and function of so-called nominalist definitions.

he develops his theory in a work on social philosophy – in his well-known
The Open Society and Its Enemies

The main feature of traditional methodology, traced back by Popper to
Plato and Aristotle, is essentialism.2 According to this methodology, the
aim of science is to discover and describe the essences of things. The
idea is that such essences are accessible to intellectual intuition and can
be spelled out in ‘essentialist’ definitions.

an essentialist definition
will have two functions: linguistic and ontological – to which we may add
a third, i.e. epistemological function.

He adds that “Aristotle’s essentialist definitions are the principles from which
all our knowledge is derived; they thus contain all our knowledge.”
