# Highlights

The endothelial to haematopoietic transition (EHT) is the process whereby haemogenic
endothelium differentiates into haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).


Using single-cell transcriptome analysis and antibody
screening, we identify CD44 as a marker of EHT enabling us to isolate robustly the different
stages of EHT in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region.

The early haematopoietic hierarchy has been described
as a three-step process based on phenotypic characteristics.
Speciﬁcally, Pro-HSC, Pre-HSC type I and type II populations
have been deﬁned based on their expression of the cell surface
markers CD41, CD43 and CD45, as well as the time taken
to mature into deﬁnitive HSCs in OP9 co-culture 13

CD44 Neg and CD44 Low Kit Neg are distinct transcriptionally. To
further compare the two endothelial populations found in the
AGM, we performed RNA-seq on 25-cell bulk samples from these
populations across 3 different time points (E9.5, E10 and E11).
