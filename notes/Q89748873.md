# Highlights

Here we show depotspecific differences in the stromal vascual fraction of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue by
performing single-cell RNA sequencing of tissue specimen from obese individuals. We
characterize multiple immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, adipose and hematopoietic stem
cell progenitors. Subpopulations of adipose-resident immune cells are metabolically active and
associated with metabolic disease status

Depot-specific analysis reveals a class of adipocyte progenitors unique to visceral adipose tissue


We identified three types of endothelial cells (E1-E3, Figure 1)

To facilitate the classification of
the cell types we subset the immune cell clusters and identified 14 new clusters, labelled as
IS1 - IS14

We followed-up this finding by performing additional
scRNA-Seq profiling on CD34- sorted SVF cells and found evidence of the presence of
metallothionein-rich T cells also in the validation sample 

further literature
mining showed that IS5 cells are rather dendritic cells due to their high expression of HLA
genes including HLA-DPB1, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPA1, HLA-DRA and HLA-DQB1

--> "these cells are rather dendritic, indeed!"

Taken together, the combined results from our SAT and
VAT single-cell data indicate presence of three depot-independent cell types: T2D-assocaited
adipocyte progenitors, fibroblasts and HPC

we failed to detect any
UCP1 expressing cells in our large single-cell data of VPM progenitors from individuals
with obesity.

. Our largest population of endothelial cells were
characterized as fatty acid handling microvascular endothelial cells due to pronounced
expression of genes encoding fatty acid transport and binding proteins

We noted that this T2D-linked cell type was characterized by genes within
the PPARÎ³ pathway, some with protective role against insulin resistance.

Finally, while our depot-specific analysis confirmed earlier efforts showing that visceralderived adipocyte progenitors originate from the mesothelium 28, we provide additional
support to the notion that a subset of these are also likely inducible by responding to
environmental stimuli and may be differentiating into beige preadipocyte
