# Highlights
 Here we isolated CD45+ haematopoietic cells from human 
embryos at Carnegie stages 11 to 23 and subjected them to transcriptomic profiling by 
single-cell RNA sequencing, followed by functional characterization of a population of 
CD45+CD34+CD44+ yolk sac-derived myeloid-biased progenitors (YSMPs) 


Mac_1 cells were mainly found in the yolk 
sac at CS11 (Extended Data Fig. 1f, g) and expressed the yolk sac-related 
gene S100A1

Much of our current knowledge of embryonic haematopoiesis is based 
on findings in animal models such as mice or zebrafish. This study 
paves the way for a wide range of explorations and analyses that were 
previously difficult to approach owing to the ambiguity surrounding 
human yolk sac-derived macrophages and their progenitors. Although 
it is widely acknowledged that mammalian haematopoiesis is highly 
conserved3, the characterization of these cells in humans has so far 
been restricted to either microscopic observations3,28

 A survey of the transcription factor landscape revealed a similar trend (Fig. 4d), 
with head macrophages losing expression of inflammatory transcrip-
tion factors such as IRF7 and STAT1 , and gaining microglial identity with 
expression of BHLHE41, JUN, FOSB, NR4A1 and SALL122; these changes 
mirror the pattern observed during mouse microglial development.


Our study will contribute to an understanding of 
the ontogeny of these iPS cell-derived macrophages.
