# Highlights
In order to overcome this limitation of the co-occurrence based ABC model, we propose a context-based approach to connecting one entity relation to another, modifying the ABC model using biological contexts. In this study, we defined four biological context elements: cell, drug, disease, and organism.

Contexts are defined as conditions or constraints that affect the relations between given entities. These may be locations, places or conditions where the entities interact. These concepts are the same as those of biological contexts in the biomedical field.
