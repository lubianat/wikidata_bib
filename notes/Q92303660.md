# Highlights
Seventeen distinct cell
subsets with new mesenchymal, pericyte,
fibroblast, and endothelial
subpopulations, new inferred
osteolineage differentiation trajectories,
and distinctions among Lepr, Nestin, and
NG2-expressing HSC niche populations
are defined.

Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to define a cellular taxonomy of the mouse
bone marrow stroma and its perturbation by malignancy.

Our taxonomy of
the stromal compartment provides a comprehensive
bone marrow cell census and experimental support
for cancer cell crosstalk with specific stromal elements to impair normal tissue function and thereby
enable emergent cancer.

Our designation of mesenchymal stromal cells does not
preclude the functional attributes of mesenchymal stem cells in
other stromal populations. Our taxonomy was based on gene
expression with annotations of putative functions; current
methods do not allow in vivo functional assessment of each
cell cluster.

--> Good point

co-expression of the classical MSC markers
Nes, NG2 (Cspg4), and the pericytes markers Acta2, Myh11,
and Mcam

hese findings provide a clear set of definitions and tools,
including refined understanding of the relation between markers
and cell types (and their limitations), clarify prior controversies,
and lead to several unexpected observations. Here, we highlight
some of these key findings.
