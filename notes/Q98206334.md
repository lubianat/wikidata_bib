# Highlights

hile the extent of chronic kidney transplant rejection (CKTR) and how it is shaped by cells and states in the kidney remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed cells from CKTR and matched healthy adult kidneys at single-cell resolution.

First, our analysis identified 15 separate cell types, including five tubular cell types (33.3%), three epithelial populations (20.0%), five types of immune cells (33.3%), one type of stromal cells (6.7%) and endothelial cells (6.7%). Second, each subclass showed distinct pathway signatures and activities, both between CKTR and normal samples or within each other, indicating that these subtypes represent different biological and molecular entities. A third observation associated major cell subclasses enriched in immune activation activities with CKTR samples
