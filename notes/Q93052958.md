# Highlights

For the mammalian spermatogenic lineage, a foundational
spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) pool arises from prospermatogonial precursors during
neonatal life via mechanisms that remain undeﬁned. Here, we mapped the kinetics of this
process in vivo using a multi-transgenic reporter mouse model, in silico with single-cell RNA
sequencing, and functionally with transplantation analyses to deﬁne the SSC trajectory from
prospermatogonia
Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that SSC fate is preprogrammed within a subset of fetal
prospermatogonia prior to building of the foundational pool during early neonatal
development.

In mice, the most well-studied mammalian model of germline
development, the origins of the spermatogenic lineage can be
traced to primordial germ cells (PGCs) that emerge from the
proximal epiblast around embryonic (E) 6.25 4 .

astly, cluster
8 encompassed a population of germ cells with lower levels of
SSC-associated markers compared to the SSC pool (cluster 7) but
lacked markers associated with progenitor (e.g. Neurog3 and
Sox3) or differentiating (e.g. Kit and Stra8) spermatogonial states.
We postulated that this cluster represents an initial population of
progenitors derived from prospermatogonia that are not destined
for the SSC pool but have yet to enter the terminal differentiation
pathway.

Based on these collective observations, we propose a conceptual model in
which the capacity to attain SSC fate during neonatal develop-
ment is not stochastic but rather preprogrammed in a subset of
prospermatogonia during fetal development
