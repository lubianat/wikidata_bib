# Highlights
“I was surprised by the number of errors,” says Eric Shoubridge, a geneticist at McGill University's Montreal Neurological Institute in Canada, who investigates human diseases that result from problems with mtDNA. “What concerns me most is that these errors could be compounded in the databases.”


In 1999, a team led by scientists at the University of Cambridge seemed to have overturned dogma when they claimed to have shown mixing of maternal and paternal mtDNA by genetic recombination5. But their results were subsequently found to be based on mistakes in the sequence.

But the region of mtDNA typically used in forensics — the 'control region' — is highly variable, says geneticist Douglas Wallace of the University of California, Irvine. “People don't appreciate the fact that the control region can undergo different mutations in different cells,” he says. For instance, there might be differences between mtDNA from someone's blood and from the same person's hair follicle. “This erodes the reliability of forensic assays,” he says.
