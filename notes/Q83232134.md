# Highlights

In zebrafish, TH has opposite effects on neural crest derived pigment cells of the adult stripe pattern, limiting melanophore population expansion, yet increasing yellow/orange xanthophore numbers

(A) Cell-type assignments for clusters of cells (n = 16,150) from euthyroid and hypothyroid fis

ikewise cells of xanthophore 1 had fewer transcripts and expressed fewer genes than cells of xanthophore 2, suggesting they may represent undifferentiated, cryptic xanthophores and actively differentiating populations


Prior analyses indicated that melanophores of euthyroid fish fail to divide whereas those of hypothyroid fish continue to do so (McMenamin et al., 2014). These findings raised the possibility that melanophores of euthyroid fish might exhibit signs of cellular senescence or other indications of proliferative cessation not observed in melanophores of hypothyroid fish. 

 Rather, our findings—combining discovery-based analyses of single-cell transcriptomic states with experiments to test specific cellular hypotheses—suggest a model whereby TH promotes maturation of both melanophores and xanthophores in distinct ways that reflect the developmental histories of these cells

  Our collected cell-types, which include immature and mature glia, differentiating pigment cells, and presumptive progenitors of different types identify new candidate genes for promoting—and recognizing—distinct states of differentiation and morphogenetic activities, and will enable efforts to define how multipotent NC progenitors are maintained and recruited into particular lineages.
