==========
  
  [@wikidata:Q111525894]  
  

# Highlights

SANT´e is a result of several years of research [4,5] and is designed for enabling RDF data publishing,
browsing, and search through keyword queries. SANT´e can be used to leverage
complex applications such as SPARQL query building capabilities using natural
language queries [3] and facet search [6].

The goal of this demonstration is to cover the necessary steps of making an arbitrary RDF data set accessible using keyword queries. W
