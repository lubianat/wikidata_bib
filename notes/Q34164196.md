# Highlights

The Alliance for Cellular Signaling (AfCS)–Nature Molecule Pages will be a comprehensive database of key facts about more than 3,000 proteins involved in cell signalling.


. But how can this vast amount of knowledge present in scientific literature be made easily accessible to the scientific community at large, rather than only to expert researchers whose research focus is the molecule of interest?

It will be freely accessible from the AfCS–Nature Signaling Gateway web site (http://www.signaling-gateway.org/). 

--> Website is down

One of the main objectives of the Molecule Pages is to provide the community with information about the function of every protein associated with cellular signalling networks, including qualitative and quantitative properties of each protein state.

As described in the accompanying papers — see introductory article (pages 703–706) and articles on the signalling networks in B lymphocytes and cardiac myocytes (pages 708–710 and 712–714, respectively) — the experiments conducted by AfCS scientists will contribute to testing and validating such interactions and transitions in specific cells of interest.

--> I wonder for how long it held up.
