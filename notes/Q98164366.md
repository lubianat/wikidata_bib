# Highlights

Here, we
develop such a custom annotation by leveraging advanced assays, such as eCLIP, Hi-C, and
whole-genome STARR-seq on a number of data-rich ENCODE cell types. A key aspect of this
annotation is comprehensive and experimentally derived networks of both transcription
factors and RNA-binding proteins (TFs and RBPs).

showcase the
application of this prioritization to somatic burdening, cancer differential expression and
GWAS. Targeted validations of the prioritized regulators, elements and variants using siRNA
knockdowns, CRISPR-based editing, and luciferase assays demonstrate the value of the
ENCODE resource.

As expected, we ﬁnd
that the target genes of MYC are signiﬁcantly up-regulated in
numerous cancer types
