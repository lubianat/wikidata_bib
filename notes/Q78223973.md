# Highlights
The creation of an open access, community-maintained database of
microbial natural product structures would enable the development of
new technologies in natural products discovery and improve the
interoperability of existing natural products data resources. However, these data are spread unevenly throughout the historical
scientific literature, including both journal articles and international patents. 

Using a combination of manual curation and automated data mining
approaches we have created a database of microbial natural products (The Natural Products Atlas, www.npatlas.org) that
includes 24 594 compounds and contains referenced data for structure, compound names, source organisms, isolation
references, total syntheses, and instances of structural reassignment.

A future goal is to align these taxonomic
assignments with the Integrated Taxonomic Identification
System (ITIS; www.itis.gov). This would provide automatic
updates to species assignments and would improve interoperability with other taxonomy-based resources.

containing a pyridine functional group as a substructure motif.

containing a pyridine motif returns 791 compounds, whose
distributions in chemical space can be displayed by projection to
the global view (Figure 4).
