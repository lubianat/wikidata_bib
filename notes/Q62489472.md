# Highlights

Formally introduced in 1986, LBD has grown to be a significant and a core task for text mining practitioners in the biomedical domain

. In an effort to be comprehensive and for ease of reference for off-the-shelf users, we also list many publicly available tools for LBD. We hope this survey will act as a guide to both academic and industry (bio)-informaticians, introduce the various methodologies currently employed and also the challenges yet to be tackled.

 For example, MEDLINE, a premier bibliographic database in life sciences, has added more than 813,500 citations in 2017 alone and at present contains more than 25 million references from approximately 5600 worldwide journals.

Likewise, to assist industry (bio)-informaticians looking for LBD tools in space, this review serves as an introduction to the methodological characteristics behind various available tools and aids them to make informed decisions for their particular use-cases.
