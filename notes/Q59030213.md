# Highlights
Sir— In his Commentary “Challenges for
taxonomy”, H. C. J. Godfray1 presents
compelling arguments for centralizing and
revitalizing taxonomy using an Internet
database of all taxon names and their
descriptions, integrated with other
biologically relevant information.


The Bacteriological Code2 already centralizes
bacterial taxonomy by ensuring that all
name changes are either published in
the International Journal of Systematic
and Evolutionary Microbiology (IJSEM)
or, if published elsewhere, are validated
by announcement in that journal.

Although Godfray is correct to say
that that current taxonomic codes prohibit
“purely electronic description”, the
current version of the Zoological Code
officially recognizes new names posted
on websites as long as five hard copies
are deposited in libraries

The ease of electronic
publishing has encouraged some
individuals to name electronically a
plethora of dubious new species, in groups
on which they have little taxonomic
expertise (I do not cite these websites
here, to avoid drawing further attention
to them). The resultant mess will take
decades to clear up.

--> Similar situation for cell types.
