# Highlights
 If diseases are detected at an early stage, prognosis can be improved and medical resources can be used more efficiently. For example, if rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is detected at an early stage, appropriate medications can be used to prevent bone deterioration. 

This framework comprises three main stages: data preprocessing, risk factor optimization, and early disease risk assessment. This is the first study integrating matrix factorization and machine learning for disease risk assessment that is applied to a nation-wide and longitudinal medical diagnostic database.
