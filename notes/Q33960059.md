# Highlights

The interaction network of human IFN- (Gene symbol: IFNG) and its vaccine-specific subnetwork were automatically extracted using abstracts from all articles in PubMed.

To systemically analyze the network of IFN- with other genes, an internally developed literature-based discovery approach based on literature mining and network centrality analysis was applied [26].
