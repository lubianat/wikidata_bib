# Highlights

PD-1 blockade unleashes CD8 T cells1
, including those specifc for mutation-associated
neoantigens (MANA), but factors in the tumour microenvironment can inhibit these
T cell responses

We fnd
both MANA- and virus-specifc clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-,
infuenza- and Epstein–Barr virus-specifc TIL each have unique transcriptional
programs.


There was considerable shared expression of selective cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL) activation genes between MANA- and EBV-specific
T cells, in particular genes encoding T cell activation and CTL activity,
such as HLA-DRA, GZMH, IFNG and NKG7 (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Data
1.3). However, genes encoding certain canonical cytolytic molecules,
such as GZMK, were expressed at low levels in MANA-specific TIL. Most
notably, EOMES, which encodes a transcription factor that is critical
for CTL activity19, was expressed in EBV-specific CD8 cells but was minimally expressed in most MANA-specific cells.
