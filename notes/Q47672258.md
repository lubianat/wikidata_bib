# Highlights
Indian science minister Murli Manohar Joshi greeted last week's revocation of a European patent on the neem tree — which the Indians have traditionally used in medicine and agriculture — almost as if it were a military victory. But his advisers know that piecemeal success will not solve the problem of ‘biopiracy’.

With this in mind, India has announced plans to create a digital database of its traditional knowledge. This will be included in the patent classification system of the Geneva-based World Intellectual Property Organization (see Nature 401, 413; 1999).
