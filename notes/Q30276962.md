# Highlights
Through evaluation of
common whole-cell and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) methods, here we show
that snRNA-seq faithfully recapitulates transcriptional patterns associated with
experience-driven induction of activity, including immediate early genes (IEGs) such as Fos,
Arc and Egr1.

For example, the response of individual
dentate granule cells (DGCs) to an experience, such as exposure
to a novel environment (NE), is highly variable and relatively
unpredictable based on current staining approaches

We characterized the transcriptome from individual activated
dentate granule neurons using snRNA-seq. The dentate
gyrus (DG), a subregion of the hippocampus, was studied
due to its importance in learning and memory 20â€“23 and its
unusually sparse activity.

We expected to observe roughly 2% of DGCs activated in the
saline-treated whole cells 10,18 and large-scale IEG activation in
DGCs of mice injected with PTZ 28 .
