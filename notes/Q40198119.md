# Highlights

We recover seven transcription factors (ERG, HOXA5, HOXA9, 
HOXA10, LCOR, RUNX1 and SPI1) that are sufficient to convert haemogenic endothelium into haematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells that engraft myeloid, B and T cells in primary and secondary mouse recipients

The generation of functional HSC-like cells from PSCs has been a 
long-sought goal in haematology research. By directed differentiation 
of hPSCs to haemogenic endothelium followed by in vivo screening of 
transcription factors for haematopoietic progenitor specification, we 
have identified seven transcription factors that together confer HSC-
like engraftment, self-renewal, and multi-lineage capacity.
