# Highlights

We have developed the Cancer Systems Biology Database (CancerSysDB), a resource for highly flexible queries and analysis of cancer-related data across multiple data types and multiple studies.

We present here the newly developed Cancer Systems Biology Database (CancerSysDB) portal which allows integrated analyses across multiple data types and across multiple cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) research network, but also from locally acquired data in a clinical context.
