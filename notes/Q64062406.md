# Highlights
However, further literature review revealed that there are several plausible
mechanisms by which DNase I might affect the course of Alzheimer’s disease. Given that DNase I is an FDA-approved drug,
with extensive studies in both animals and man in the context of other diseases, I suggest that investigation of DNAse I in
Alzheimer’s disease is worthwhile.


Here, I examine clinical case reports
concerning AD, looking for unexpected, surprising,
or serendipitous observations which 1) in my judge-
ment, are scientifically intriguing, 2) have apparently
not been followed up, 3) that suggest new potential treatments, causes, or risk factors of AD, and 4) that
are ripe for further investigation.

The single exception appears to be a most
surprising report which used orally administered
deoxyribonuclease I as adjunctive therapy: A patient
with severe AD with deterioration of functioning
was given 40 mg of human recombinant DNase I
(1500 KU/mg) three times a day in conjunction with
continued memantine therapy (10 mg daily), and
apparently produced rapid and lasting improvement
of cognition [12].
