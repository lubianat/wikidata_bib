# Highlights
An extensive single-cell catalog of cell
types in the mid-gestation human
neocortex extends our understanding of
early cortical development

Defines intermediate cell transition states during early
neurogenesis

Implicates specific cell types in neuropsychiatric disorders


Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define
cell types and compile cell-type transcriptomes in the devel-
oping human neocortex. We focus on the cortical anlage at
mid-gestation (gestation week [GW] 17 to GW18) (Figure 1A),

At a depth of 40,000 cells,
we obtain stable transcriptomes representing 3,000â€“5,000 genes
for most cell types present (Table S4).

--> Many cluster names (presumably cell types)



To deconvolute the cell-type specificity of regulatory elements,
we leveraged a recently generated map of regulatory elements
active in developing fetal cortex and their putative target genes
(de la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018)

Figure 4. (A) tSNE colored by Seurat clustering and annotated by major cell types.


We next reasoned that we could use this atlas of developing hu-
man brain cell types to identify the developmental stages and
cell types in which mutations causing high risk for neuropsychi-
atric disease act so as to provide a reference for understanding
disease mechanisms and circuits (Figure 7).
