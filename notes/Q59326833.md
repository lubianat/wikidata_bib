# Highlights
Here we employ single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to proﬁle the impact of an Rbf mutation
during Drosophila eye development.

First, we build a catalogue of 11,500 wild type eye disc
cells containing major known cell types.

For example, investigating the mutant phenotype of Rbf, encoding the
pRB ortholog, provided key insights into the function of Rbfin
development. Like in mammalian cells, inactivation of Rbf in the
larval eye imaginal disc results in mild cell-cycle defects and
apoptosis


A cell atlas of the wild-type third-instar larval eye disc

o unbiasedly classify cell types, we performed a t-
stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) analysis using Seurat 8 and
identiﬁed 15 distinct cell clusters (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 1).

We concluded that photo-
receptors cluster irrespective of R-cell type. However, after column
4, photoreceptors initiate axonogenesis 6 and this transcriptional
switch distinguishes late (LPR) from early (EPR) photoreceptors

Our wild-type catalog
contains ~11,500 cells and is comparable with the estimated
count of 10,000 cells in the eye disc 24 . This 1× cellular coverage
proved sufﬁcient to identify known domains, cell types and states.
