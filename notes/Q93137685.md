# Highlights
Neutrophils are a component of the tumor microenvironment and have been predominantly associated
with cancer progression

Neutrophils were essential for the activation of an
interferon-g-dependent pathway of immune resistance, associated with polarization of a subset of
CD4 CD8 unconventional ab T cells (UTCab).

Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) were virtually absent in Csf3r/ tumors (Figures
S2B and S2C)

Natural killer (NK)
cells are known to be important IFNg producers (Vivier et al.,
2018) and have been shown to undergo a functional conversion
toward ILC1 during sarcoma progression (Gao et al., 2017), but
no difference was observed in abundance or maturation state
of the NK cell compartment in Csf3r/ tumors (Figures S3G
and S3H)


), UPS patients were divided into TANhigh and
TANlow subgroups. The resulting Kaplan-Meier curve showed
that patients with TANhigh tumor biopsies at diagnosis had a significant survival advantage compared to TANlow patients and a
trend was observed for recurrence-free survival
