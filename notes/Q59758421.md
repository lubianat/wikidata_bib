# Highlights
Table 1: Metanodes. Hetionet v1.0 includes 11 node types (metanodes). For each metanode, this
table shows the abbreviation, number of nodes, number of nodes without any edges, and the
number of metaedges connecting the metanode.

Before adding relationships, all identifiers needed to be converted into the vocabularies matching
that of our nodes. Oftentimes, our node vocabularies included external mappings. For example, the
Disease Ontology includes mappings to MeSH, UMLS, and the ICD, several of which we submitted
during the course of this study [107]. In a few cases, the only option was to map using gene
symbols, a disfavored method given that it can lead to ambiguities.
