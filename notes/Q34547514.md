# Highlights
A strategy for barcoding CRISPRmediated perturbations allows pooled
expression profiling via single-cell RNA
sequencing.

To deliver and capture GBCs, we designed the ‘‘Perturb-seq
vector,’’ a third-generation lentiviral vector that contains two
notable features: an RNA polymerase II-driven ‘‘GBC expression
cassette’’ and an RNA polymerase III-driven ‘‘sgRNA expression
cassette’’ (Figure 1B). T

To systematically delineate IRE1a-, PERK-, and ATF6-controlled
transcriptional programs and to expand Perturb-seq to the analysis of higher-order genetic interactions, we sought to design a
vector that could mediate robust and homogeneous perturbation of gene combinations in individual cells
