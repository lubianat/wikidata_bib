# Highlights
Recent studies employing single-cell RNA-sequencing
(scRNA-seq) or single nuclei RNA-seq have provided broad characterization of the composition of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF)
and adipocytes of human WAT

Our analysis of approximately 110,000 human cells present in
the SVF of human WAT revealed 28 distinct cell types, including
8 previously uncharacterized immune populations. 


adipose-resident NK cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs).

WAT mNK cells phenotypically overlap with
CD56dim NK cells, WAT iNK and trNK cells were phenotypically distinct from CD56bright NK cells and potentially represent unique subsets of the NK-cell lineage found in the WAT

 LYVE1, SELENOP and C1Q, expressing PVMs
