# Highlights

Aminopyrazine-treated human islets retain functionality in vitro and after transplantation into
diabetic mice. Oral dosing of these compounds in diabetic mice induces b-cell proliferation,
increases b-cell mass and insulin content, and improves glycaemic control. Biochemical,
genetic and cell biology data point to Dyrk1a as the key molecular target.

Aminopyrazine treatment of rat and human primary b-cells
induces entry into cell cycle when measured by staining for Ki67,
