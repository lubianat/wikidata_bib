# Highlights
Here we report the analysis of astrocytes in multiple 
sclerosis and its preclinical model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) 
by single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with cell-specific Ribotag RNA profiling, 
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC–seq)

By focusing on astrocytes expressing S100b, Gja1, Aldh1l1, Gfap and Aqp4, we identified several subpopula-
tions of astrocytes (Fig. 1b–d, Supplementary Table 2, Extended Data 
Fig. 1g–i), suggesting that astrocytes adopt multiple transcriptional 
states during EAE


o identify additional astrocyte regulators that are active during EAE 
we used RibotagGfap mice, which express a haemagglutinin-tagged ribo-
some subunit under the control of a Cre recombinase driven by the 
Gfap promoter (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b, Supplementary Table 4). 
The transcriptional analysis of RibotagGfap mice detected decreased 
expression of NRF2-driven genes during EAE (Extended Data Fig. 5c).
