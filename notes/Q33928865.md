  [@wikidata:Q33928865]  

# Highlights
A tool for manual curation of abstracts. 

http://www.bioqrator.org/

BioQRator was tailored for protein–protein interaction (PPI) annotation by migrating information from PIE the search

BioC for input and output.

BioQRator was designed to annotate entities and re- lationships from literature available in PubMed or from any document formatted in the BioC standard

The full annotation task for PPI showed no significant differences between manual and BioQRator annotation times. However, the time was reduced by 30% for a beginner-intermediate level curator.
