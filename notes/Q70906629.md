# Highlights

Here,
we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of ~10,000 cells from normal liver tissue of 9 human
donors to construct a human liver cell atlas. Our analysis revealed previously unknown sub-types
among endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and hepatocytes with transcriptome-wide zonation of some
of these populations

Based on the expression of marker genes, our atlas comprises all the main liver cell types,
including hepatocytes, EPCAM+ bile duct cells (cholangiocytes), CLEC4G+ liver sinusoidal
endothelial cells (LSECs), CD34+PECAMhigh macro-vascular endothelial cells (MaVECs), 

To explore the relatedness of these sub-populations, we reanalyzed the EPCAM+ population
with RaceID3 and employed StemID2 for lineage reconstruction
