# Highlights

 Planarians undergo whole-body regeneration and tissue turnover, providing a model for adult positional information studies

 Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing of 115 muscle cells from distinct anterior-posterior regions identified 44 regionally expressed genes, including multiple Wnt and ndk/FGF receptor-like (ndl/FGFRL) genes.

wo significant principal components that separated cells by expression of muscle markers (PC1<0) and expression of neoblast markers (PC2<0) were identified

The planarian pharynx is a long muscular organ that can extend through the mouth to ingest food (Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004) and connects to the intestine through the esophagus at the medial anterior end of the pharyngeal cavity. 

We utilized single-cell sequencing to map axial gene expression within the planarian muscle

Animals
Asexual Schmidtea mediterranea strain (CIW4) animals starved 7–14 days prior experiments were used.
