Biological databases are a relatively new medium for the storage of biological
information. However, the emphasis on the design and development of these
databases has primarily been in recording the data generated from experiments, such
as nucleotide sequences, proteins, metabolic pathways, gene expression etc. [1,2,3,4]


In order to interpret the relationships between taxonomic names
(concepts), one must know, not only the classification assumed by the original
publication, but also the nomenclatural and taxonomic changes that relate that
classification to others

 Graph structures are
fundamental basic structures which can be used to describe many biological data
types in addition to the increasingly pervasive requirement for ontologies.
