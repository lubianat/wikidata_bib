# Highlights
We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a cell atlas of the chick retina. We identified 136 cell types plus 14 positional or developmental intermediates distributed among the six classes conserved across vertebrates – photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion, and glial cells.

Altogether, transcriptomic and morphological studies have identified a total of >130 neural (neuronal and glial) cell types in mice and ~70 in primates (Yan et al., 2020a; Yan et al., 2020b; Peng et al., 2019).

All known chick retinal cell types are born by E14, retinal structure is relatively mature by E18, and birds are visually competent at hatching

Chicks are tetrachromatic, with cone types that express red opsin (OPN1LW), green opsin (OPN1MSW), blue opsin (OPN2SW), or violet opsin (OPN1SW) (Kram et al., 2010; Enright et al., 2015). In addition to these conventional ‘single-cones’ (SCs), the retina also contains rods that express rhodopsin (RHO) and OPN1LW-expressing ‘double-cones’ (DCs) composed of tightly apposed principal and accessory cells, which together comprise about half of all PRs (Smith et al., 1985; López-López et al., 2008; Oishi et al., 1990)

Initial histological studies of avian retina distinguished two HC types: Type I, which bears an axon, and Type II, which does not (Cajal, 1892; Mariani and Leure-DuPree, 1977)
