# Highlights
One reason for
this paucity of data is that most cell counting studies focus on large regions without examining
their subdivisions (Figure 1B). For example, while it is possible to find reported cell and neuron
numbers for larger cortical regions such as visual, somatosensory, or auditory areas (Herculano-
Houzel et al., 2013), the cellular content of their subdivisions into smaller functional areas or even
layers remains unknown.

reliable estimates would provide a solid foundation for large initiatives to understand the
brain (Markram et al., 2011) to reach a consensus on cell types (Jorgenson et al., 2015), and to
reconstruct and simulate the brain (Markram, 2006)

represent astrocyte markers (A), oligodendrocyte markers (B), and microglia markers (C)

We found the
Substantia Nigra (SN) and Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of the
Midbrain to be composed to 37.6 and 63.8% of dopaminergic
neurons
The 3D cell atlas (bbp.epfl.ch/nexus/cell-atlas) has been designed
to provide a global overview of the brain cell composition,
while also allowing the user to study specific regions in detail
