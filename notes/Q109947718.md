# Highlights

However, these data are complex and fragmented, creating a significant barrier to their integration and reuse. Data are generated for different research purposes at thousands of facilities across the world, with diverse formats, annotations, methodologies and metadata standards.

Here, we describe how ELIXIR has evolved to be an established research infrastructure, with a review of significant milestones achieved, and a look into the future. By linking national networks that span most of Europe’s major research centers ELIXIR is in a unique position to drive the transformation of life science’s distributed data resources within Europe to be sustainable, federated, standards-based and cost-effective.
