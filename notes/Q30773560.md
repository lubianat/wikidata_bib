# Highlights
In a process that recapitulates
the steps of embryogenesis, many
specialized, transit-amplifying cells can
reform stem cells

. Regeneration defects are more severe in embryonic than in adult root mutants. Furthermore, the signaling domains of the hormones auxin
and cytokinin mirror their embryonic dynamics and
manipulation of both hormones alters the position
of new tissues and stem cell niche markers. Our findings suggest that plant root regeneration follows, on
a larger scale, the developmental stages of embryonic patterning and is guided by spatial information
provided by complementary hormone domains

Cells were classified using the Index of Cell Identity (ICI) algorithm, which can identify stable and transitional fates using single-cell expression data (Birnbaum and Kussell, 2011; Efroni
et al., 2015). We used a reference dataset of 579 identity marker
genes (Tables S1 and S2) to classify cells into 14 root tissue
types (Figure S3A; Table S3), which we grouped as stele, QC,
columella, epidermis/LRC, and ground tissue (Figures 3Aâ€“3D).
