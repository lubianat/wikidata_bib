# Highlights
The Mouse Tumor Biology (MTB) database (http://tumor.
informatics.jax.org) is a comprehensive information resource of
mouse models of human cancer. T

--> Site is still working. Nice. 


Key insights into the molecular genetics of cancer
initiation and progression have been discovered using genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMM; ref. 9)

To make external genomic datasets about mouse models "findable," MTB curators associate datasets with semantically consistent metadata for strain name and tumor type.
