# Highlights
This review summarizes the current understanding of the role of mast cells in many pathophysiological conditions.

The lungs do not have many mast cell progenitors in a normal physiological state. Upon antigen-induced inflammation of the respiratory endothelium, mast cell progenitors are recruited by engaging α4β7 integrins, VCAM-1, and CXCR2. Additionally, CCR-2 and CCL-2 are involved in the recruitment of mast cell progenitors to the respiratory endothelium. When mature mast cells are activated and degranulated, more mast cell progenitors are recruited to the site of inflammation (5).

There are two phenotypes of human mast cells: mucosal mast cells that produce only tryptase and connective tissue mast cells that produce chymase, tryptase, and carboxypeptidases (6, 7).

Mucosal mast cells in the nasal epithelium are activated by antigens that diffuse across the mucosa after being inhaled.

IgE is mostly found bound to FcϵRI receptors on the mast cell, and very little IgE is found as a soluble antibody
in circulation. When an antigen comes in contact with the mast cell, it crosslinks two or more FcϵRI molecules and activates
the release of granules from the mast cell (13).
