# Highlights

We present ROS- and diabetes-related targets (genes/proteins) collected from the biomedical literature
through a text mining technology.

SciMiner, a web-based literature mining tool
[14], was used to retrieve and process documents and
identify targets from the text. SciMiner provides a con-
venient web-based platform for target-identification
within the biomedical literature, similar to other tools
including EBIMed [15], ALI BABA [16], and PolySearch
[17]; however, SciMiner is unique in that it searches full
text documents, supports free-text PubMed query style,
and allows the comparison of target lists from multiple
queries.
The ROS-diabetes targets collected by SciMiner were
further tested against randomly selected non-ROS-diabetes
literature to identify targets that are significantly over-
represented in the ROS-diabetes literature.
