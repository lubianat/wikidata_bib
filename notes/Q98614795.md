# Highlights
d scRNA-seq is feasible in metastatic human NSCLCs and
reveals a rich tumor ecosystem
d Individual tumors and cancer cell

Cancer and tumor microenvironment cells exhibit marked
therapy-induced plasticity

We also queried scRNA-seq data for mutations from the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations In Cancer) lung adenocarcinoma tier 1 mutations.

Interestingly, we identified an alveolar cell gene-expression
signature composed of 17 established gene markers of alveolar
cells (Vieira Braga et al., 2019; Wade et al., 2006) that showed
significantly increased expression in RD versus TN time points
(p < 0.0001; Figure 3A; Figure S3B; Table S2). Alveolar cells are
comprised of alveolar type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) subtypes
and form the lining of the lung alveoli.

We next addressed the evolution of the TME during targeted
treatment. Immune cells (n = 13,431) were clustered and annotated (Figure 4A; Tables S1 and S4). In contrast to clusters of
cancer cells, which were predominantly patient specific (Figures
S2C and S2D), immune cell-type clusters showed low patient
occupancy (Figure 4B).
