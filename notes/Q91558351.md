# Highlights

Here, we proﬁle four human iPSC lines for a total
of 450,118 single cells to show how organoid composition and development are comparable
to human fetal and adult kidneys. Although cell classes are largely reproducible across time
points, protocols, and replicates, we detect variability in cell proportions between different
iPSC lines, largely due to off-target cells.

D29 organoids from all four iPSC lines contained cells
representative of segments of a developing nephron (Fig. 1c, d
and Supplementary Fig. 2): podocytes (NPHS2, podocin; NPHS1,
nephrin; SYNPO, synaptopodin; WT1, Wilms Tumor 1),
proximal tubular (PT) cells (LRP2, megalin), thick ascending
limb (TAL; SLC12A1, Na-K-Cl cotransporter), and distal nephron
cells (CDH1, E-cadherin; AQP2, aquaporin 2; GATA3).

There was
no cluster enriched for SLC12A3 (Na-Cl symporter; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2), a canonical marker of the distal convoluted tubule
(DCT).

We validated cell type markers using immunoﬂuorescence (IF)
staining (Fig. 2a–c, Supplementary Figs. 7, 8)

We thus concluded that transplantation
abrogated SOX2+ neuronal and PMEL+ melanoma off-target
cells, and may have promoted organoid maturation toward a
more advanced human-like state. Taken together, these data
showed that transplantation reduced off-target cells, improving
organoid quality.


Finally, we addressed the critical issue of organoid quality
with respect to off-target cells. Recent reports focused on
eliminating neuronal off-target cells from kidney organoids by
using an NTRK2 blocker 17 . However, NTRK2 is not only
expressed in off-target neuronal cells, but also abundantly
expressed in podocytes 65,66 in both fetal human kidneys 67 and
developing organoids (Supplementary Fig. 24A, C)
