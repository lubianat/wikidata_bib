# Highlights

Here, we identified
Ms4a3 as a specific gene expressed by granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and subsequently generated Ms4a3TdT reporter, Ms4a3Cre,
and Ms4a3Cr

During Listeria monocytogenes infection,
liver-resident macrophages undergo necroptosis in conjunction
with rapid monocyte infiltration to give rise to monocyte-derived
Kupffer cells (KCs)

Monocyte Contribution to RTMs during Inflammation Is
Model Dependent
Inflammatory stimuli often induce monocyte recruitment; these
monocytes might potentially contribute to RTMs upon the resolution of inflammation
