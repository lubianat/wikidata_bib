# Highlights
. Here we report single-cell RNA proﬁling of mouse mammary
epithelial cells spanning four developmental stages in the post-natal gland.

Interrogation of single-cell transcriptomes reveals different levels of diversity within the luminal
and basal compartments, and identiﬁes an early progenitor subset marked by CD55.
Moreover, we uncover a luminal transit population and a rare mixed-lineage cluster amongst
basal cells in the adult mammary gland.

Large-scale scRNA-seq identiﬁes luminal intermediates in the
adult. To investigate molecular heterogeneity more fully within
the mammary epithelial compartment, we used the 10X Genomics
Chromium platform to proﬁle gene expression in thousands of
individual cell
