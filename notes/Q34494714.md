# Highlights
Miyamoto et al. have developed a non-invasive method to spot resistance by sequencing RNA transcripts in single circulating tumor cells (CTCs

We established single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) profiles of 77 intact CTCs isolated from 13 patients (mean six CTCs per patient), 

Although these observations require validation in prospective trials, they point to complex and heterogeneous drug resistance mechanisms in advanced prostate cancer, which may affect therapeutic efficacy.
