# Highlights
. We used a freely available, web-based discovery technique (Semantic MEDLINE) supported by semantic relationships to automatically extract information from MEDLINE titles and abstracts.
We assumed that testosterone is associated with sleep (the A-C relationship in the paradigm) and looked for a mechanism to explain this association (B explanatory link) 

Review of full-text papers in critical nodes discovered in this manner resulted in the proposal that testosterone enhances sleep by inhibiting cortisol.

o this end, we utilized a database discovery method—never before used in sleep medicine—to comprehensively examine the literature and uncover mechanisms underpinning the etiology of diminished sleep quality in aging men.
SemRep predications have a subject argument (“Sulfones”), a predicate (“TREATS”), and an object argument (“Sleep Disorders”).
