# Highlights
 Developing Dictyostelium cells can completely reverse their differentiation in around 24 hr (Takeuchi and Sakai, 1971; Finney et al., 1987; Katoh et al., 2004)

 In this study, we have carried out a detailed transcriptomic analysis of the dedifferentiation process in Dictyostelium and combined this with single cell imaging, to order the progression of gene expression and cell physiological changes occurring as cells dedifferentiate

 his is in effect a dispersal strategy, bet-hedging against the potential for a proliferative disadvantage occurring within the dormant spore state. Meaningful parallels between the dedifferentiation responses of Dictyostelium and mammalian cells seem more likely in situations where mammalian cells dedifferentiate as part of the normal course of events, such as during responses to tissue damage and metabolic stress.
