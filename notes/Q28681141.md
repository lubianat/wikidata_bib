# Highlights

 PubTator was shown to be capable of improving both the efficiency and accuracy of manual curation. PubTator is publicly available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/PubTator/.
In response to a call for participation in BioCreative 2012 Interactive Text Mining task (13), we developed PubTator, a web-based application that provides computer assistance to biocurators (14).

The reported F1 scores (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) of different tools were either taken from their corresponding publications or assessed by us on public benchmarking datasets.

PubTator can be used for annotating bio-entities of any kind by following steps detailed in our online tutorial page (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Lu/Demo/PubTator/tutorial/index.html#DefineBioconcepts).
