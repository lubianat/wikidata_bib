# Highlights
This work introduces BASiNET, an alignment-free tool for classifying biological sequences based on the feature extraction from complex network measurements.

The proposed methodology is implemented in open source in R language and freely available for download at https://cran.r-project.org/package=BASiNET.

The PLEK (predictor of long non-coding RNAs and messenger RNAs based on an improved k-mer scheme) (21) is an alignment-free method, i.e. does not depend on alignment with pre-existing databases.

# Comments

Three classes: mRNA, lncRNA and sncRNA
