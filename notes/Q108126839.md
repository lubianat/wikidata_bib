# Highlights

Our approach captures knowledge from the literature pertaining to SNPs and imaging readouts in a causal model encoded in Biological Expression Language (BEL) [16] to support the functional interpretation of SNPs in a clinical context. In a case scenario, we propose KANSL1 as a candidate gene mediating the connection between the genetic variants and hippocampal atrophy. 

Manually generating mechanistic hypotheses by linking genetic variants to neuroimaging markers is a daunting task. Therefore, in order to empower com-puter-aided reasoning, the extracted knowledge ass-embly was encoded in BEL. Both the syntax and semantics of BEL encoded in the knowledge assembly were validated using the PyBEL framework.


 The resulting KANSL1 knowledge assembly was validated using PyBEL [19] and integrated into NeuroMMSig [20]. Finally, NeuroMMSig was then used to investigate the putative role of KANSL1 in neuroimaging feature alteration, namely hippoc-ampal atrophy.
