# Highlights

Construction of a single-cell mouse cell atlas (scMCA)
covering major cell types

Using Microwell-seq, we analyzed more than
400,000 single cells covering all of the major mouse
organs and constructed a basic scheme for a mouse
cell atlas (MCA).

Finally,we constructed a ‘‘single-cell MCA (scMCA)’’ tool that accurately defines cell types based on single-cell digital expression

To enable public access to these data, we constructed the
mouse cell atlas website at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/MCA. T

. Moreover, we observed a large category
of mammary gland resident immune cells, including T cells
(C2, C3, C6, C11, C13), B cells (C4), natural killer (NK) cells
(C10, C16), dendritic cells (C8, C12), monocytes (C9), and macrophages (C14).

C11 might be a novel cell type physically between brush border cell and S1 cells. The Osgin1+ C4 is suspected to represent S2 cells. S3 proximal tubule cells (C8) express Kap, Keg1, Napsa, and Slc22a13. 

(D) A hierarchical clustering heatmap showing differentially expressed genes (row) across 60,000 mouse cells clustered into 98 cell types (column). Yellow
corresponds to a high expression level; purple and black correspond to low expression levels.

--> Mixing clusters and cell types

Clara cells (enrichment of secretoglobin family genes Scgb1a1, Scgb3a2 in C12), and ciliated cells (enrichment of 1110017D15Rik and Foxj1 in
C18).

--> nooo, stop using Clara cells, nazi eponym

C6 represents pancreas-specific stromal cells that express Col15a1, Gdf10,
and Col4a1. Uterus-specific C2 is a novel stromal cell population
that is marked by Col6a4 and Col6a3, as well as many predicted
genes, such as Gm11361, Gm12248, and Gm8797. C10
also comes from the uterus
