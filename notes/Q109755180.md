# Highlights
This incredible progress takes us closer to answering a general
question that motivates stem and developmental cell biologists, as
well as the HCA project: what is the complete cellular makeup of the
human body? Annotating cells and gene programmes is crucial not
only to address this question but also to fully exploit these data for
biological discovery, including in pathological states.

Cell atlasing (that is, the creation of a cell atlas) of mammalian brains has led to the discovery of previously uncharacterized cell types, including more than 100 cell types in a single region of the neocortex8, as well as of cellular diversity due to species-specific adaptations in the cortex8. A similar dramatic increase in diversity has been reported in the peripheral nervous system such as in the enteric nervous system9,10.

Ontologies of cell types such as those in Cell Ontology (CL)12 and Drosophila Anatomy Ontology13 are increasingly being used to annotate single-cell transcriptomics data.
. By contrast, the definition of Kupffer cells records that they are ‘located in’ (the lumen of) the hepatic sinusoid. In an anatomically higher hierarchy, the definition of hepatic sinusoid involves relations to the liver lobule and the liver overall, which is in turn defined by its structure, location and physiological role in the body.
