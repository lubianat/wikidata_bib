# Highlights
However, the extent of human oligodendrocyte heterogeneity and its possible contribution to MS pathology remain unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing from white matter areas of post-mortem human brain from patients with MS and from unaffected controls. We identified subclusters of oligodendroglia in control human white matter, some with similarities to mouse, and defined new markers for these cell states. 

Notably, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis indicated that the highest-expressed genes in these clusters were not myelin genes (Extended Data Fig. 6), which suggests that these mature stable oligodendrocytes do not need to maintain strongly active transcriptional machinery for myelination but instead a transcriptional network that reinforces signalling, cell-to-cell adhesion and viability. 

We quantified OLIG1/OLIG2-expressing cells from a different patient cohort and, despite there being fewer cells generally in demyelinated lesions, the percentage of OLIG1/OLIG2+ cells in lesions did not change in these lesions compared with NAWM and control white matter (Fig. 3a). 


Our dataset has the advantage that we could identify and compare expression of potential biological markers in different lesion types, NAWM and control white matter, albeit on a limited number of patients. 

This highlights the difficulties in extrapolation from rodent to human and further emphasizes the power of studying human pathology at a single-cell level to inform appropriate therapeutic approaches.
