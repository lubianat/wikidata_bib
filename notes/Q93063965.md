# Highlights

Functionally matured NK cells with high
expression of CX3CR1, HAVCR2 (TIM-3), and ZEB2 represents terminally differentiated status
with the unique transcriptional proﬁle.

Transcriptomic and pseudotime analyses identify a
transitional population between CD56 bright and CD56 dim NK cells. Finally, a donor with
GATA2 T354M mutation exhibits reduced percentage of CD56 bright NK cells with altered
transcriptome and elevated cell death

nlike murine NK cells, which primarily develop in the bone
marrow (BM), human NK cells are shown to differentiate in the
secondary lymphoidal organs where most of their precursors and
immature cells are located 6

n contrast to this simple CD56- and CD57-
based (CD56 bright → CD56 dim CD57 − → CD56 dim CD57 + ) deve-
lopmental paradigm, mass cytometry (CyTOF)-based immune
proﬁling has revealed thousands of phenotypically distinct NK
cells depending on the combinatorial expression of 28 cell surface
receptors

The remaining CD7+ CD56− CD16− NKp80− cells could be ILCs/
NK progenitors, ILCs, immature NK cells, or immature cells with
multiple lineages potentials 13 .

, Supplementary Data 1 and 2), we named each cluster in the BM samples: “CD56 bright
NK,” “Transitional NK,” “Active NK,” “Adaptive NK,” “Mature
NK,” “Terminal NK,” and “Inﬂamed NK.” (Fig. 1a).

A transitional subset links CD56 bright and CD56 dim NK cells.

Unique transcriptomic proﬁle of adaptive NK cells. Another
subset of NK cells that we identiﬁed was the “Adaptive NK”
cluster, which was found in the BM.
