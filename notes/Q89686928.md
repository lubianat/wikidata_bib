# Highlights

Here we report that a homologue of the claustrum,
identifed by single-cell transcriptomics and viral tracing of connectivity, also exists in
a reptileâ€”the Australian bearded dragon Pogona vitticeps


In Pogona, the claustrum underlies the generation of sharp waves during slow-wave sleep. 

The sharp waves, together with superimposed high-frequency ripples2
, propagate to the entire neighbouring pallial dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR)

Using transcriptomic approaches, we also
identifed a claustrum in the turtle Trachemys scripta, a distant reptilian relative of
lizards

Using a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) strategy, we previously
mapped the main neuronal types of the reptilian pallium11 and described
heterogeneity among glutamatergic cell types in the Pogona DVR. To
characterize the amDVR, we sampled Pogona single cells more deeply
and more extensively.
