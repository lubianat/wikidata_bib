The Cell Ontology (CL) aims for the representation of in vivo and in vitro cell types from all of biology.

We have now addressed the specific content of one area of the CL, the section of the ontology dealing with hematopoietic cells

Within the Mouse Genome Informatics resource (www.informatics.jax.org) the CL is used in conjunction with Gene Ontology (GO) during annotation of mouse gene products to indicate the cell type in which a gene product is active.

NIAID sponsored the “Workshop on Immune Cell Representation in the Cell Ontology,” held in May 2008

We have focused on structural criteria where possible as the primary differentia, but have utilized other types of differentia when necessary. This flexibility is required to adhere to the commonly accepted biological definitions of individual cell types.

In the first stage, which is now complete, we revised current terms and added new terms so that all hematopoietic cell type terms now have textual definitions that contain all the necessary details to define the cells logically.

In restructuring the ontology for the hematopoietic cells, we have eliminated the multiple inheritance via the artifactual high-level terms such as “cell by histology” “cell by nuclear number,” or “cell by function.”

In general the hematopoietic terms are presented as species neutral, but species-specific information is incorporated in some definitions where necessary and comments have been added to provide clarity to data annotators, especially in cases where certain cell types have no close homologue in another species.

The work described herein represents a significant advance in the representation of hematopoietic cell types in the Cell Ontology, and will increase the utility of the ontology for data annotation, integration, and analysis in this domain in both research and clinical settings.
