# Highlights

Using single-cell RNA-seq and lineage tracing, we analyzed cellular diversity in medulloblastomas in transgenic, medulloblastoma-prone mice, and responses to the SHH-pathway inhibitor vismodegib. In untreated tumors, we ﬁnd expected stromal cells and tumor-derived cells showing either a spectrum of neural progenitor-differentiation states or glial and stem cell markers.

e. In order
to compare medulloblastomas to the normal tissue of origin, we
used Drop-seq to generate single-cell transcriptomic data from
the early postnatal cerebellum. We studied cerebella from ﬁve
wild-type (WT) mice at P7, a time with an abundance of both
proliferating and differentiating CGNPs


The cells of Nodes A V –C V predominantly localized to the multi-
cluster CGNP group, and mapped in an orderly progression to
successively more differentiated regions (Fig. 3e). Of the cell types
present in the P7 WT cerebellum, the cells of Nodes A V –C V most
closely matched the CGNPs and showed a range of differentiation
states that parallel the CGNP developmental trajectory.
