# Highlights

Using the concept of heat diffusion, we have devised an algorithm that is able to calculate the magnitude of
regulation of a biological network using expression datasets

This study is one of the first attempts that enable quantification of mechanisms represented as biological
networks. We have been able to quantify the magnitude of regulation of a biological network and illustrate that the
magnitudes are different across spatial and temporal resolution.


However, pathway databases do have some limitations.
Firstly, they lack context specific representation of know-
ledge when it comes to disease specificity

Several algorithms have been proposed to use pathway
databases to assist in the interpretation of high-
throughput -omics data.

In this study, we have deployed the CMPA algorithm on
two mechanisms, one each from PD and AD. This has
allowed us to quantify perturbed mechanisms and show
that the amplitude of the perturbations are affected by
the differentially expressed genes.

The causal relationship in OpenBEL, which forms the basis
of making the OpenBEL knowledgebase computable, is
the key in devising the CMPA algorithm. Without the
information on the causality of the interacting bio-
logical entities, measuring the amplitude of a regulated
mechanism is not possible
