# Highlights

The index, called OpenAlex after the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt, also aims to chart connections between these data points to create a comprehensive, interlinked database of the global research system, say its founders

The database, which launched on 3 January, is a replacement for Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG)

In response to MAG’s closure, non-profit scholarly services firm OurResearch in Vancouver, Canada, created OpenAlex, using part of a US$4.5-million grant from London-based charity Arcadia Fund.

OpenAlex draws its data from MAG’s existing records and from other sources including Wikidata identifiers, ORCID, Crossref and ROR, says Jason Priem, co-founder of OurResearch.

OpenAlex is also free to use, thanks to sponsorship from Amazon Web Services, 

Frode Opdahl, chief executive of Keenious, a start-up firm based in Tromsø, Norway, which scans millions of papers to suggest relevant references, says he’s pleased with the documentation published about OpenAlex. “It makes it a lot easier to work with and implement into our product,” he says.
