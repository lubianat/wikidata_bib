# Highlights
Although the inherent pigmentation of the RPE cells have
been useful to grossly evaluate differentiation efﬁciency and allowed manual isolation of
pigmented structures, accurate quantiﬁcation and automated isolation has been challenging.
To address this issue, here we perform a comprehensive antibody screening and identify cell
surface markers for RPE cell

In the present study, we identify CD140b, CD56, GD2, and
CD184 as central cell surface markers to evaluate hPSC-RPE
differentiation efﬁciency

Identiﬁcation of CD140b + GD2 − and CD184 − as hPSC-RPE
markers.

We identiﬁed that CD140b (PDGFRB) is speciﬁcally expressed on the RPE as they
emerge during in vitro differentiations in several independent
hPSC lines and can prospectively identify RPE cells from alter-
native cell types.
