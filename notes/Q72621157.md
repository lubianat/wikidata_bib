# Highlights
PyKEEN is a framework, which integrates several approaches
to compute knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs)

We have demonstrated the usage of PyKEEN in predicting missing links in KGs
from the biomedical domain.
In particular, we performed HPO for three KGE models (i.e., TransE, TransR, and ComplEx) and selected the best performing
to provide predictions to a domain expert which manually evaluated the top
ranked predictions. 
Finally, that this workflow that can be applied in any domain
highlights the effectiveness of PyKEEN to discover novel knowledge.


PyKEEN (Python KnowlEdge EmbeddiNgs), BioKEEN (Biological
KnowlEdge EmbeddiNgs), and the KEEN Model Zoo for sharing experimental
artifacts.

In particular, we focus on the use of PyKEEN in predicting missing
links between genes and biological pathways as well as their internal hierarchies.

The two most confidence predictions suggest that RXRA and UPP1 play
a role in Nuclear Receptors in Lipid Metabolism and Toxicity and Pyrimidine
metabolism pathways, respectively. A survey of the recent biomedical literature
suggests that RXRA is involved in lipid metabolism and UPP1 in the degradation and salvage of pyrimidine ribonucleosides

 Interestingly, the third predicted link that suggests the involvement of EZR, a cytoplasmic peripheral gene, in the disease Shigellosis has been previously described by [10] in which they implicated the gene in the process of Shigella bacterial uptake.
