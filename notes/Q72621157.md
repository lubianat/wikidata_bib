# Highlights
PyKEEN is a framework, which integrates several approaches
to compute knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs)

We have demonstrated the usage of PyKEEN in predicting missing links in KGs
from the biomedical domain. In particular, we performed HPO for three KGE
models (i.e., TransE, TransR, and ComplEx) and selected the best performing
to provide predictions to a domain expert which manually evaluated the top
ranked predictions. Finally, that this workflow that can be applied in any domain
highlights the effectiveness of PyKEEN to discover novel knowledge.
