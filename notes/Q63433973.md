# Highlights
Knowledge workers like researchers, students, journalists, research evaluators or funders
need tools to explore what is known, how it was discovered, who made which contributions,
and where the scholarly record has gaps. Existing tools and services of this kind are not
available as Linked Open Data, but Wikidata

While the marketplace oﬀers a range of services with overlapping functionality, none of the
available options are community-curated, most use proprietary code, and those few that
are based on free and open-source software make use of non-open data, which impedes
further aggregation and reuse.

Competing products either restrict data export or require software installation to present
data visualizations of the kind that Scholia provides in any modern browser using just
JavaScript and Wikidata.

The core team consists of Daniel Mietchen, a biophysicist and data scientist at the Data
Science Institute at the University of Virginia, along with Finn Årup Nielsen, a computer
scientist and neuroscientist in DTU Compute at the Technical University of Denmark who
started Scholia, and Egon Willighagen, a chemist in the Department of Bioinformatics at M
aastricht University.

The authors would like to acknowledge the WikiCite community's contributions to
bibliographic and related data in Wikidata and to Scholia's documentation and code

The project is funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation under grant number
G-2019-11458.
