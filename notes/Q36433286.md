# Highlights

These rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) constitute a quite unique cell type that distinguishes
RA from other inflammatory conditions of the joints.

These changes appear to reflect a stable activation of RASFs, which occurs independently of continuous exogenous
stimulation. As a consequence, RASFs are no longer considered passive bystanders but active players in the complex
intercellular network of RA.

In this scenario, the production of cytokines and chemokines within the
rheumatoid synovium would help to recruit T cells, macrophages
and neutrophils, which, in turn, attract more inflammatory cells
and, ultimately, enhance the activated state of the RASFs and
of osteoclast

RASFs are characterized by a round, large pale nucleus
with prominent nucleoli, indicating very active RNA metabolism.

Such cytokines, together with growth factors, thus play an
important role both in the continuous stimulation of RASFs
towards aggressive behaviour as well as in the crosstalk between
RASFs and other cell types in the synovium.
