# Highlights
• INs-seq: a new technology for recording scRNA-seq and intracellular protein activity
• INs-seq defines new immune subsets by TF combinations and metabolic activity
• Mapping Arg1+ cells within tumors reveals novel Trem2+ suppressive myeloid cells
• Genetic ablation of Trem2 decreases Mreg, exhausted CD8+ T cells and tumor growth

Comprehensive mapping of Arginase 1-expressing cells within tumor models, a metabolic immune signature of suppressive activity, discovers novel Arg1+ Trem2+ regulatory myeloid (Mreg) cells and identifies markers, metabolic activity, and pathways associated with these cells.


MDSCs do not conform to conventional surface marker-based classification schemes and are classified using broad myeloid surface markers, various cellular assays, and metabolic properties, including expression of an immunosuppressive metabolic pathway expressing Arginase 1 (Arg1) (Arlauckas et al., 2018; Veglia et al., 2018).

Our data revealed a new Trem2+ regulatory monocyte population, regulatory myeloid (Mreg) cells, as major myeloid suppressive cells in a mouse fibrosarcoma syngeneic tumor model


To better understand the complexity of the myeloid response to pathogen signals, we stimulated the bone marrow culture with LPS and performed INs-seq fixation and intracellular staining with fluorescent pp38, a downstream component of the TLR4 signaling cascade

 Comprehensive Cell Type Characterization by TF Targeting

The TCF7+ ID2+ DP gate defined less characterized T cell subsets and was specifically enriched for two cell states of central memory (CM) and one state of effector memory (EM) T cells (Figure 3H)


To deeply characterize myeloid suppressor cells within the TME, we applied INs-seq to isolate and profile Arg1-expressing cells from a mouse tumor model and define their cellular and molecular pathways (Figure 4A).
