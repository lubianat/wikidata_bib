# Highlights
The National Microbiome Data Collaborative (NMDC) is a new initiative to support microbiome data exploration and discovery through a collaborative, integrative data science ecosystem.

Collaborative partnerships and broad community
engagement are central to the success of the NMDC.
With the goal of enabling a shared ownership of microbiome data, the NMDC is working to establish support
for open science and FAIR data across research teams,
funders, publishers and societies.

Efforts to develop national resources for microbiome
data have recently been initiated, including the Australian
Microbiome Initiative and the Brazilian Microbiome
Project
10, and ideally these efforts could coordinate on
an international level.
