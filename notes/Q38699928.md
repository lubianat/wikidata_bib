# Highlights

Skin migDCs maintain tolerance to self-antigens, despite individual populations having known specialization when licensed to
prime during pathogen encounter (

We use this program
to identify a single highly enriched and developmentally
conserved transcript within the 227 signature, suppressor-ofcytokine-signaling 2 (SOCS2).


Third, we included a
comparison of the same signatures from LN-resident classical
DCs (cDCs) derived from blood-born precursors against those
migDC subsets in LN that have migrated from skin

Transcriptomes of 333 BDCA1+ DC, BDCA3+
DC, and monocytes from a patient with melanoma
visualized by tSNE


To isolate these cells, we used an enrichment strategy for lineage negative (lineage: CD3/CD20/CD56/
CD66b) CD45+
CD11c+
HLA+ cells, distinguishing CD14+ cells as
enriched for monocytes from BDCA1+ and BDCA3+ expressing
populations by flow cytometry.
