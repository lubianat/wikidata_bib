# Highlights
Facilitating large-scale hypothesis testing and generation from huge collections
of literature, LBD could significantly support scientific research [15]. However,
based on fairly shallow techniques (e.g. dictionary matching) current LBD captures only some of the information available in literature.

 Closed discovery (i.e.
hypothesis testing) assumes a potential relationship between concepts A and C
and searches for intermediate concepts B that can bridge the gap between A
and C and support the hypothesis.

The starting point is to gather relevant literature via PubMed â€“ for example,
all the MEDLINE abstracts and freely available full text articles from journals in
relevant sub-areas of biomedicine (e.g. cell biology, toxicology, pharmacology, and
medicine, among others).
