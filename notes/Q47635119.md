# Highlights
s. We do not believe that biological
data are that different from complex data in other fields. Our experience has led us to
emphasise simplicity and conservative technology choices when building these databases.

Often one will have aspects of a
particular database that are considered to
be ‘invariable’ experiment-based data
(such as sequence information, or readouts from microarray chips)

 Often storing the
interpretation of ‘low-level’ data is the
raison d’eˆtre of a database:in the case of
Ensembl we developed a highly effective
automatic gene-building system, and the
main feature of the system was the
calculation, storage and display of this
interpretation.


GENERAL DATABASE
IMPLEMENTATION POINTS

Always use source code control

Do not use text files in
directories as a poor-person’s
database

Only use cutting edge
technology if you really have to
Even then think twice about it.

ms. In our experience one needs two
types of tracking identifiers – internal
database identifiers that are used only in
database joins and programmatic bindings
of code to database, and then ‘published’
but still anonymous identifiers which can
be tracked by other databases (in Ensembl
these would be an ENSG number, in
Swiss-Prot/SPTrEMBL, these are
accession numbers, etc)

It almost goes without saying that we
advocate a straightforward ‘objectoriented’ approach to code. 


A final common problem to biological
databases is to lose the biological focus of
the database; symptoms can include
having web pages that have prominent
displays of the database-oriented
information (such as tracking identifiers)
or deploying technology to access
databases which requires considerable
programming skill to simply install
