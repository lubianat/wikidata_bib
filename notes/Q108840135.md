# Highlights

Each PubMedQA instance is composed of (1) a question which
is either an existing research article title or
derived from one, (2) a context which is the
corresponding abstract without its conclusion,
(3) a long answer, which is the conclusion of
the abstract and, presumably, answers the research question, and (4) a yes/no/maybe answer which summarizes the conclusion
