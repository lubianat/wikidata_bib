# Highlights


y combining single cell transcriptome and functional analyses, we identified a subpopulation of IL-10-producing Foxp3neg
CD4+ T cells that displays regulatory activity unlike other IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells, which
are unexpectedly pro-inflammatory

The combinatorial expression of co-inhibitory receptors is
sufficient to discriminate IL-10-producing CD4+ T cells with regulatory function from others
and to identify them across different tissues and disease models in mice and humans

Also, IL-10-producing Foxp3negative (neg) CD4+ T cells, usually
referred to as T regulatory type 1 cells (TR1),

Here, by combining transcriptomic analysis at the resolution of
single cells and functional experiments in mouse and humans we
have shown that IL-10-producing Foxp3neg CD4+ T cells are a
functionally heterogeneous population of cells

ifferent across distinct clusters (Fig. 1f).
Collectively, these data revealed a remarkable degree of
heterogeneity amongst splenic IL-10-producing Foxp3neg CD4+
T cells. T
