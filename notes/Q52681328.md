# Highlights

NCBIâ€™s PubTator in Medline abstracts an 
Stanford dependency parser to find connecting dependency paths 
clustering to group the dependency paths into semanticallyrelated categories
We evaluated our theme assignments against six human-curated databases: DrugBank, Reactome, SIDER, the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), OMIM, and PharmGKB.


The complete network is available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/1035500)

Our approach uses distributional semantics both to learn a schema and to map diverse surface forms onto relational classes.
It draws from ideas in biomedical ontology learning.

For each cluster, a set of 10 dependency paths was selected at random, and a human annotator examined the paths and several associated
example sentences from the literature to assign a label. 

Nearby clusters sometimes shared similar themes, so we simplified the clusters into
thematically-related groups and assigned each theme a symbol. Supplement A contains the complete set of intermediate labels and sample
dependency paths for each cluste

We used known relationships from six human-curated databases to evaluate the validity of our themes.

In the example patterns above, C represents the chemical and G the gene/protein.

--> Very cool!

Our final dataset is a network with labeled, weighted edges. Because a
single dependency path can support multiple themes, the network is a
multigraph.

--> As they are generally very useful, this is compatible with Wikidata.

The full network is available in two parts on Zenodo
(https://zenodo.org/record/1035500).
Part I connects dependency paths to themes. Each record contains a
dependency path followed by the supports for each theme, and indicators
for whether or not the path is part of the flagship path set for each theme.
Part II connects sentences to dependency paths. It consists of sentences and associated metadata, entity pairs found in the sentences.

Part II contains 4,451,661 records,
of which 92,465 (2.1%) represent chemical-gene dependency paths,
3,875,209 (87.1%) are chemical-disease paths, 338,306 (7.6%) are genedisease paths, and 145,681 (3.3%) are gene-gene paths

5.1 Summary of our approach and its advantages
We have constructed a labeled, weighted network of structured biomedical relationships for all Medline abstracts

 The most difficult and timeconsuming part of the process is the manual labeling of the clusters, and
this need only be performed once


Its most significant downside is that it relies on the co-occurrence of different dependency paths to map rarer paths to themes.
There are a large number of dependency paths that (a) never co-occur with another path, and (b) occur with only one entity pair

Finally, the named entity recognition provided by PubTator, while state-of-the-art, is not perfect.
