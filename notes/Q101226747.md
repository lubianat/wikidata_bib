# Highlights

Here we show that calcitonin, a hormone product of the thyroid gland involved in 
bone metabolism3, is also produced by atrial cardiomyocytes in substantial quantities 
and acts as a paracrine signal that affects neighbouring collagen-producing 
fibroblasts to control their proliferation and secretion of extracellular matrix 
proteins.

Human patients with persistent atrial fibrillation show sixfold 
lower levels of myocardial calcitonin compared to control individuals with normal 
heart rhythm, with loss of calcitonin receptors in the fibroblast membrane

Using primers specific 
for the mRNA splice variants that encode CT and αCGRP, we detected the 
expression of both CT and αCGRP transcripts in atrial tissue and in isolated 
ACMs and ACFs, but not in epicardial fat (Fig. 1a–c).
 CT protein was detect-
able in the secretome of human ACMs, but not ACFs (Fig. 1d). 

Through this work, we identified a previously undescribed CT–CTR 
paracrine signalling system in the human atrium. Human ACMs repre-
sent a substantial source of CT that, through binding to the CTR on the 
ACF membrane, controls fibroblast proliferation and BMP1-related 
collagen processing. Disruption of the CT–CTR axis permits excessive 
atrial fibrogenesis and promotes arrhythmogenesis. Restoration of the 
CT–CTR functional cascade might thus help to control the development 
of the AF-related arrhythmogenic substrate in humans
