# Highlights
• Cell identity is retained during aging despite exponential decline of gene expression
• SCope: An online tool to explore and compare single-cell datasets across species

This single-cell brain atlas covers nearly all cells in the normal brain and provides the tools to study cellular diversity alongside other Drosophila and mammalian single-cell datasets in our unique single-cell analysis platform: SCope (http://scope.aertslab.org)

The Drosophila brain is ideal to build an atlas of cell types of a complex functioning brain because it encodes an extensive array of intricate behaviors (Owald et al., 2015) while only consisting of approximately 100,000 cells, of which 85%–90% are neurons (Kremer et al., 2017).

We find 24,802 cells (43.6%) that are cholinergic (VAChT), 13,296 (23.4%) glutamatergic (VGlut), and 6,177 (10.8%) GABAergic neurons (Gad1). A smaller subset of monoaminergic neurons all express the vesicular transporter-encoding gene Vmat and can be further subdivided into serotonergic (SerT), octopaminergic/tyraminergic (Tdc2), and dopaminergic (ple) neurons 

We used this approach to test whether a particularly small neuronal population of only ∼9 neurons per hemisphere is present in our dataset (Figure 2A). These neurons are a subset of the dorsal fan-shaped body neurons (dFB) and are genetically targeted using R23E10-Gal4 (Figure 2A).

In this work, we report a comprehensive single-cell compendium of an entire intact adult brain during aging
