# Highlights
In this report we present lncRNAWiki (http://lncrna.big.ac.cn), a wiki-based platform that is open-content and publicly editable and aimed at community-based curation and collection of information on human lncRNAs.

Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org), an online encyclopedia, is an extraordinarily successful example that relies on the community knowledge in information integration and allows people from all over the world to create/edit any content. Wikipedia features collaborative information integration, huge coverage, up-to-date content as well as low-maintenance cost.

Here we present our developed lncRNAWiki (http://lncrna.big.ac.cn). This platform is wiki-based and open-content, publicly editable and aimed at community curation of human lncRNAs.

‘AuthorReward’ quantifies participants’ contribution considering both edit quality and edit quantity, and provides explicit authorship based on these quantified contributions. It has been successfully demonstrated in RiceWiki (32), where it has attracted more than 800 participants in collaborative curation of ∼600 genes.

In lncRNAWiki, community-curated efforts are quantified and rewarded by explicit authorship, aiming to encourage more participants from the wider scientific community in collective and collaborative curation of lncRNAs.
