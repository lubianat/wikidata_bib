# Highlights

But delegates at the World's Indigenous Peoples conference, held on 16â€“19 October in Kelowna, British Columbia, described how some groups are concerned that the databases could be used to exploit their cultural heritage. Some Canadian tribes, for example, already have individual databases. But a national project, conducted on a shoe-string budget by the Centre for Traditional Knowledge at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, has suffered because indigenous groups are reluctant to make their databases available. The groups fear that secret traditions associated with plants or substances will be stolen, according to government officials working on the project.
