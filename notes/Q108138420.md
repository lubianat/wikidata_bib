# Highlights
 We propose to address these challenges by
developing an interactive atlas of invasion science that can be extended to other disciplines in the future.
This online portal, which we aim to create in the course of the project described here, will be an evolving
knowledge resource and open for anyone to use, including researchers, citizen scientists, practitioners and
policy makers. 

The quote by John Naisbitt from the 1980s that we are “drowning in information but starved for knowledge” (p. 24 in Naisbitt 1982) thus seems to be more
applicable than ever before

For example, the Texas A&M University Libraries paid in 2019 ca. US$ 212,000 for the Web of Science and ca. US$ 140,000 for Scopus (Tabacaru 2019).


An open database that could possibly be used by Open Knowledge Maps is the opensource linked data system Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_
Page; Lemus-Rojas and Odell 2018; Ayers et al. 2019; Waagmeester et al. 2019). Yet
although this database has high potential (e.g. Waagmeester et al. 2020; Rutz et al.
2021), it currently does not systematically cover the different scientific disciplines. As
preliminary work, we thus included >26,000 publications of the field of invasion science in Wikidata, where they can be explored in a domain-general way through tools
like Scholia (https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/topic/Q42985020; Nielsen et al. 2017;
Rasberry et al. 2019).

These features will be developed in five work packages: (WP1) conceptual classification system integrating research questions and invasion hypotheses; (WP2) interactive
evidence synthesis; (WP3) semantic data structures based on WP1 that will automatically ingest the literature into Wikidata; (WP4) engaging with the research and Wiki
community; and (WP5) data-driven visualization techniques based on artificial intelligence (Fig. 2).

The website hi-knowledge.org (https://
hi-knowledge.org) is a first attempt to combine these two approaches, as it features
a zoomable (hierarchically structured) hypothesis network.

In WP3, we will build semantic data structures – also known as knowledge graphs –
in Wikidata that are based on persistent identifiers for publications, authors, research
questions, hypotheses and the relationships between them, focal non-native species,
study locations, research methods etc. (Fig. 1).

Since Wikidata uses Semantic Web standards and its data are in the public domain, other knowledge graphs
such as ORKG (Auer et al. 2021) will be able to reuse and build on the curation work
performed in the framework of enKORE.
