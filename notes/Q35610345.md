# Highlights

The objective of this study is to identify T2DM–specific salivary biomarkers by literature–based discovery. A serial interrogation of the PubMed database was performed using MeSH terms of specific T2DM pathological processes in primary and secondary iterations to compile cohorts of T2DM–specific serum markers. 

The PubMed database was serially interrogated using specific medical subject heading (MeSH) terms representing the primary sets of interest (P1, P2, and P3) and the secondary sets of interest (S1, S2, etc),

Each marker was counted once irrespective of the number of publications and the type of saliva (DS or NDS) (Fig. 1B). All searches and manual curation were performed independently by two faculty members and two student investigators. The retrieved information was assessed for similarity. In case of discrepancies, all four individuals repeated the search and consensus was reached after discussion.
