# Highlights


d 51 cell subsets in colon mucosa of 18 ulcerative colitis and 12
healthy individuals


d M-like cells, inflammatory monocytes and fibroblasts, and
CD8+
IL-17+ T cells expand in disease
d Oncostatin M circuit in inflammatory monocytes and
fibroblasts may affect drug response

We generated 366,650 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes
from 68 biopsies (each 2.4 mm2
) from colonoscopic examinations of 18 UC patients under different treatment regimens and
12 healthy individuals

Our census revealed that enterocytes expressing BEST4 are
distinct from other epithelial cells

Multiple fibroblast subsets differ by expression of WNT/
bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling genes, likely reflecting distinct positions along the crypt-villus axis 

--> - 2.4.7.5 Differentia for cell classes: sub-organ regions

Microfold (M) cells are typically associated with lymphoid tissue in the human small intestine, where they are important for
recognition of the gut microbiota (Mabbott et al., 2013). In the
colon, M-like cells were rarely found in healthy individuals
