# Highlights

We identify previously unknown cellular subtypes, including gradients of progenitor cells, colonocytes and goblet cells within intestinal crypts. At the top of the crypts, we
find a previously unknown absorptive cell, expressing the proton channel OTOP2 and the satiety peptide uroguanylin,
that senses pH and is dysregulated in inflammation and cancer. 


Goblet cells are critical for the maintenance of the colonic barrier,
through both the production of mucus and the transportation and
presentation of luminal antigens to tolerogenic dendritic cells, particularly the CD103+ type

EEC populations further divided into L-cells, enterochromaffin cells
and precursor-like cells, identifying novel markers of colonic EECs
(Extended Data Fig. 1c–e).

 The cells of this cluster expressed markers of mature colonocytes, with distinct expression of the calcium-sensitive chloride channel BEST4 (Fig. 2a, i, iii
and Extended Data Fig. 2c, i), the protease cathepsin E (Extended Data
Fig. 2c, ii, iii) and the OTOP2 gene (Fig. 2a, ii, iii), so we designated these
cells ‘BEST4/OTOP2 cells’.

We have characterized an absorptive cell type, the BEST4/OTOP2
cells, which are capable of pH sensing and may maintain luminal homeostasis through regulation of the GC-C signalling pathway. These cells
selectively express uroguanylin, the endogenous paracrine hormone
required for GC-C activation. GC-C receptor signalling occurs in a
pH-dependent manner and modulates key physiological functions,
including fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, maintenance of epithelial
proliferation, barrier function, DNA integrity, epithelial–mesenchymal
crosstalk and microbiota composition4
