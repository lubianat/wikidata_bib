# Highlights

lterations in the microbiota can also modulate host behaviours—such as social activity, stress, and anxiety-related responses—that are linked to diverse neuropsychiatric disorders

ingle-nucleus RNA sequencing of the medial prefrontal cortex of the brain revealed significant alterations in gene expression in excitatory neurons, glia and other cell types. Transcranial two-photon imaging showed that deficits in extinction learning after manipulation of the microbiota in adult mice were associated with defective learning-related remodelling of postsynaptic dendritic spines


we first treated adult mice with antibiotics (termed ABX mice)17 and used a classical cued fear conditioning and extinction learning paradigm

conditioning and extinction learning assay in adult germ-free (GF) mice

 Again, both ABX and GF mice exhibited impaired extinction learning

 However, extinction learning led to significant differences in the transcriptomes of mPFC tissue from ABX and control mice (Fig. 1f, g)


 we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of mPFC samples dissected from ABX and control mice

To investigate whether signals derived from the microbiota regulate learning-related neuronal activity in the mPFC, we used two-photon imaging and a genetically encoded calcium sensor (AAV5–hSyn–GCaMP6s) to quantify neuronal activity during extinction learning in control and ABX mice (

Notably, following colonization with segmented filamentous bacterium (SFB)36, Clostridium species37, Enterobacter species38 or altered Schaedler flora (ASF)39, these gnotobiotic mice still exhibited impaired extinction learning compared to control mice (Fig. 5a), suggesting that a more diverse microbiota is required for normal extinction learning and fear extinction behaviour

However, when ex-GF mice were colonized immediately after birth by fostering to microbiota-replete specific-pathogen-free (SPF) surrogate mothers (ex-GF_fostered mice), their fear extinction behaviour was comparable to that of control_fostered mice (Fig. 5d),

This study informs a model in which alterations in exposure to the microbiota in neonatal and adult mice can have considerable and long-lasting effects on neuronal function and learning-related plasticity that subsequently regulate fear extinction behaviour (
