# Highlights

. T cell receptors (TR) are divided into two groups, αβ and γδ, which express distinct TR containing either α and β, or γ and δ chains, respectively. The TRα locus (TRA) and TRδ locus (TRD) of bovine (Bos taurus) and the sheep (Ovis aries) have recently been described and annotated by IMGT® biocurators. The aim of the present study is to present the results of the biocuration and to compare the genes of the TRA/TRD loci among these ruminant species based on the Homo sapiens repertoire. 


This study was carried out in order to highlight the differences between the IMGT® annotation and the data previously published and to compare the TRA/TRD loci among bovine and sheep against the human locus
