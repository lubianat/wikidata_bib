# Highlights
Besides, an automatic memory optimization has been realized in order to
optimally exploit the provided hardware. Through the integration of Optuna, extensive
hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) functionalities are provided

In PyKEEN 1.0, a KGEM is considered as a composition of four components that can flexibly be combined: an interaction model (or model architecture), a loss function, a training
approach, and the usage of inverse relations.

To ensure the composability of KGEMs, the interaction models, loss functions, and training approaches are separated from each other and implemented as independent submodules, whereas the modeling of inverse relations is handled by the interaction models.

To facilitate the composition of KGE models for non-experts, we provide the pykeen.pipeline.pipeline() functions, which provides a high-level entry point into the functionalities of
PyKEEN.
