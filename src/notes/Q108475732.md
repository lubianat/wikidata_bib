# Highlights

About 10% of human proteins have no annotated function in protein knowledge bases. A workflow to generate hypotheses for the function of these uncharacterized proteins has been developed, based on predicted and experimental information on protein properties, interactions, tissular expression, subcellular localization, conservation in other organisms, as well as phenotypic data in mutant model organisms. This workflow has been applied to seven uncharacterized human proteins (C6orf118, C7orf25, CXorf58, RSRP1, SMLR1, TMEM53 and TMEM232) in the frame of a course-based undergraduate research experience named Functionathon organized at the University of Geneva to teach undergraduate students how to use biological databases and bioinformatics tools and interpret the results. 

course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). In CUREs, students learn the scientific method (recognizing and formulating a research problem, collecting data, formulating hypotheses and testing them) by addressing a research question that is of interest to the scientific community (6)

ommunity Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontologies (CACAO), a competition for intercollegiate teams, incorporated nearly 800 undergraduates over a decade to generate about 5000 Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for species spanning all domains of life based on experimental observations published in the literature (8)

--> Cool

The workflow has been tested with undergraduate students on seven preselected proteins. Compared to the CACAO project, which is conceived as a competition, the Functionathon course is a collaborative project. Tutors give feedback all along the course and build functional predictions together with the students, which is closer to the situation in which masterâ€™s or PhD students work
