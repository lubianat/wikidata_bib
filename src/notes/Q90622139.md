# Highlights

We present the Small RNA Expression Atlas (SEAweb), a web application that allows for the interactive querying, visualization and analysis of known and novel small RNAs across 10 organisms. It contains sRNA and pathogen expression information for over 4200 published samples with standardized search terms and ontologies. In addition, SEAweb allows for the interactive visualization and re-analysis of 879 differential expression and 514 classification comparisons. 

 To harvest the true potential of existing data, it is important to allow for querying, visualization and analysis of sRNA-seq data across organisms, tissues, cell types and disease states. This would allow researchers, for example, to search for disease-specific sRNA or pathogenic biomarker signatures across all disease entities investigated. Data integration and interoperability require (i) a streamlined analysis workflow to reduce analysis bias between experiments (ii) also necessitates standardized annotation using ontologies to search and retrieve relevant samples and (iii) flexible and interactive visualization of the data.


Named entity recognition software ProMiner (18) and MiRNADetector (19) are used to detect and normalize genes and miRNAs,

SEAweb stores sRNA expression information, sRNA differential expression, sRNA-based classification, pathogenic sRNA signatures from bacteria and viruses, pathogen differential expression, miRNA gene targets and disease association as well as deep and standardized metadata on the samples, analysis workflows and databases used.
