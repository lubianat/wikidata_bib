# Highlights

After about E14, radial glia gradually
lost proliferative capacity and switched to a glioblast state that eventually generated astrocyte, ependymal and oligodendrocyte precursor
(OPC) cells. Major classes of cells appeared in successive waves 


s. In agreement, here we found that
embryonic non-telencephalic glioblasts and OPCs of mixed forebrain,
midbrain and hindbrain origin were distinct from telencephalic glioblasts (Fig. 3a; Extended Data Fig. 6d, e). These observations suggest a
loss of regionalization, particularly in the oligodendrocyte lineage.

Our detailed examination of these cells (Fig. 3f,
g, Extended Data Fig. 7) revealed primitive fibroblast-like cell states
that expressed Mkx, Alx1, Alx3 and Tbx18 at E9, which differentiated
into pia (Col15a1) and arachnoid (Slc22a2) by E15. We also found dura
(Ccn3, previously known as Nov) and perivascular fibroblast-like cells
(Tcf21), but their relationship to the meninges lineage was unclear.

--> What would be the difference between "fibroblast-like" and fibroblast? Also - high granularity, uh? difficult to parse
