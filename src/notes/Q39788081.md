# Highlights

 However, accumulating experimental evidence has demonstrated that these mutations exert their impact on gene functions via splicing accuracy, mRNA stability, translation fidelity, protein folding and expression, and some of these mutations are implicated in human diseases. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no database specially focusing on disease-related SMs.

 But ‘synonymous’ is different from ‘same’, and accumulating evidence suggested that SMs could have functional consequences 

currently, there are many databases that focus on point mutation, such as dbNSFP (Liu et al., 2013) and miRNASNP (Gong et al., 2015). However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no database that can provide comprehensive resources for the disease-related SMs.

In the current version, dbDSM collected 1936 SM-disease association entries, including 1289 SMs and 443 human diseases from ClinVar, GRASP, GWAS Catalog, GWASdb, PolymiRTS database, PubMed database and Web of Knowledge.
