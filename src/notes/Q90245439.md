# Highlights

Using single cell RNA-sequencing and high resolution 3D imaging, we further demonstrate that organoid cultures derived from Wilms tumours consist of multiple different cell types, including epithelial, stromal and blastemal-like cells.

 To verify that organoid cultures contain different Wilms tumour cell types, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses on four different Wilms tumour organoid lines
# Comments

focus on tumours; a bit out of my scope.
