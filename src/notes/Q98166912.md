# Highlights

To understand the roles for the epididymis in reproductive biology, we generated a single-cell atlas of the murine epididymis and vas deferens. 

ing droplet-based (10X Chromium) single-cell RNA-Seq, we profiled gene expression in 8880 individual cells from across the epididymis and the vas deferens.

--> Nice size.
(A) Single-cell cluster (expanded from Figure 1C) with 21 clusters annotated according to predicted cell types. Inset shows coarser cell type groupings used for downstream subclustering.

--> Super specific "types"

Clear cells are largely responsible for one of the best-known functions of the epididymis, which is to provide an acidic luminal environment that ensures that sperm remain quiescent until mating occurs

--> Cool! I did not know that.
