# Highlights

In all adult mammals analyzed so far, UBCs show an unevendistribution within the granule cell domains of the hindbrain,their highest density of occurrence being in the median cerebellarcortex, part of the flocculus/paraflocculus complex, and layers 2–4 of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (


The history of the UBC represents a particular case, as thecell came to light nearly 150 years after the first description ofthe much larger Purkinje neuron (Purkyné, 1837). This processof discovery is still ongoing.

Hámori and Szentágothai (1966; see alsoEccles et al.,1967) were the first to publish electron micrographs of catcerebellar glomeruli containing dendrites that are nowrecognizable as UBC's brush dendriole  

Monteiro (1986)later added the information that neurons heclassified as Golgi cells in the rat cerebellum could form suchchestnut-like synapses not only on the cell body but also ondendritic shafts

 Another intriguing possibility may be that the UBCs, ifnoticed, were ignored because they did not fit with currentepistemic systems. Many of the old histological archives haveunfortunately been dispersed or discarded; and to our knowl-edge the presence of UBCs in classical Golgi collections has sofar not been verified

 he existence of two subclasses of UBCs was also supported byexpression of the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1and VGLUT2; indeed, CR+UBCs were found to be VGLUT1+/VGLUT2+, whereas the mGluR1α+subset only expressed theVGLUT1 subform and none of the subsets expressed VGLUT3(Nunzi et al., 2003)

6.The UBC subclassesIt was the cerebellar immunolocalization of glutamate recep-tors that brought about the first clear signs of complexity inthe UBC lineage, albeit the signs were a corollary of studiescentered primarily on the glutamatergic mossy fiber UBCsynapse (Rossi et al., 1995).6.1.   Calretinin and mGluR1α

BC maps in the cerebellumand cochlear nucleus of different species indicate that thispeculiar cell is involved in functions, such as the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic reflexes, that are evolutionary adap-tive. Yet, because of its peculiar morphology, the UBC is oftenconsidered an“exotic”type of cell. Its peculiarity and paucityin hemispheral folia have conjured against inclusion of UBCsin earlier and newer attempts to elaborate a basic cerebellarcomputational algorithm (Ito, 2006, 2008; Dean et al., 2010;Bower, 2010)

Moreover, as specificity among neuronal cell classesrequires the concerted action of many different genes,attention on the UBCs may also favor the discovery of genesconferring to them cell autonomous properties as well as ofgenetic mutations specifically affecting the cell class

Really extensive, great review of UBCs.
