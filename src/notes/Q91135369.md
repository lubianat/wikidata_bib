# Highlights
he database is notably enhanced through the continued linking of relevant pharmacology with key immunological data types as part of the IUPHAR Guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY (www.guidetoimmunopharmacology.org) and by a major new extension, the IUPHAR/MMV Guide to Malaria PHARMACOLOGY (www.guidetomalariapharmacology.org).

A dedicated portal has been developed to provide quick and focused access to these new data.

The International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (IUPHAR) and the British Pharmacological Society (BPS) have jointly developed the Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (shortened to GtoPdb) from the antecedent IUPHAR-DB, a resource focused on receptors and channels that was first compiled in 2003 (1–3), and the BPS ‘Guide to Receptors and Channels’ (4),

As previously described (7), GtoImmuPdb was designed to incorporate immunological data types and associate these with existing targets and ligands. This enrichment includes immunological processes, cell types and diseases. The methodology for process and cell type inclusion was described in our last update but, in summary, we have used Gene Ontology (17,18) biological process terms and Cell Ontology (19) cell types to underpin top-level categories against which we have annotated protein targets (Table 2).
