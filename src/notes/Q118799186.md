# Highlights

In this paper, we use the example of the CEUR-WS publishing platform to show a viable approach to transition from a traditional
HTML/PDF/text based environment to a single point of truth that separates the data and metadata
storage from its presentation. This is possible using a public infrastructure such as Wikidata, which
minimizes the maintenance effort and improves the publishing workflow.

We report on the successful start of semantification of CEUR-WS with Wikidata as a target knowledge
graph with the goal to achieve consistency and continuity for the future.
The challenge was in handling the textual natural language description parts of the CEUR-WS content
that is inherently still part of the semi-digitized approach of using HTML and PDF. We propose to have a
better separation of concerns of metadata, display and storage and started implementing it.


Given the HTML/PDF/text input of CEUR-WS, we need to create the corresponding Knowledge Graph and separate the single-point-of-truth computer readable metadata from the different
representations such as HTML so that the above requirements are fulfilled


Our first contribution is to provide the tools, infrastructure and approaches to modify the CEURWS publication workflow to consistently supply FAIR high quality metadata (Semantification)


The Semantification of CEUR-WS has been publicly pursued by the Semantic Publishing challenge [12] from 2014. Given an excerpt of CEUR-WS, scholars were asked to prepare a RDF
knowledge graph to allow for a set of 20 queries to be answered to complete Task 1.


A study about Linked Data [25] found that each year about 10% of Linked Data URIs are no
longer dereferencable. One way to mitigate the issue is to introduce persistent identifiers (PIDs),
which aim to fulfill the following principles [26]: longevity, scalability, extensibility, and security
