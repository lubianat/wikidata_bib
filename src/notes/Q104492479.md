# Highlights

Demonstration of inflammation-induced plasticity of sensory innervation of lymph nodes
Transcriptome-based identification of nociceptor target cells in lymph node
To uncover LN-resident cells that may interact with LN-innervating sensory neurons

Neuro-immune interactions have been investigated in a number of settings, especially in the central nervous system (CNS) (Klein et al., 2017; Norris and Kipnis, 2019; Prinz and Priller, 2017), and several recent studies have uncovered evidence of bidirectional communication between the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the immune system in the spleen, bone marrow, intestine, airways, lungs, and skin (Baral et al., 2019; Chiu et al., 2012; Foster et al., 2017; Godinho-Silva et al., 2019; McMahon et al., 2015; Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2015; Veiga-Fernandes and Mucida, 2016). However, the mechanisms and consequences of these multi-faceted interactions are still poorly understood.

In many cases, nociceptor modulation of immunity involves bioactive neuropeptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P, which are released from activated peripheral terminals of nociceptors and act on various immune and stromal cells that express the corresponding receptors (Assas et al., 2014; Baral et al., 2019; Suvas, 2017).


Using scRNA-seq of retrogradely labeled DRG neurons, we identified four molecularly distinct LN-innervating sensory neuronal subtypes with strong enrichment for peptidergic nociceptors.

o nominate the putative cellular communication partners of these sensory neurons, we used Seq-Well-based scRNA-seq to generate a single-cell “atlas” of murine steady-state LNs. By in-silico-matching known ligands and receptors expressed by LN-innervating sensory neurons and each LN-resident stromal and immune subset, we determined that stromal cells exhibit the highest potential for interaction with local sensory fibers.

 LNs are innervated by sensory and sympathetic neurons

Having confirmed that LNs are innervated by sensory and sympathetic neurons, we next asked whether either type of innervation depended on the presence of the other. 

he entire organ is covered by a collagen-rich capsule that is penetrated by afferent lymph vessels that discharge lymph into the subcapsular sinus (SCS), a fluid-filled space that is densely lined by specialized macrophages and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)

Sensory fibers were generally absent from postcapillary HEVs, the paracortical microvascular segments that express peripheral node addressin (PNAd), where blood-borne lymphocytes adhere and emigrate into LNs 


). Because soma size and myelination status are commonly used, together with other electrophysiological properties, to classify DRG neurons into functional subtypes (Wood et al., 2018), sensory neurons innervating LNs are likely composed of qualitatively distinct neuronal subtypes.

Next, we directly classified LN-innervating or skin-innervating sensory neurons relative to the 11 DRG subtypes in the Usoskin et al., 2015 atlas and the 15 in the Sharma et al., 2020 atlas (STAR Methods; Figures 4D and S4C). We recovered 4 transcriptionally distinct neuronal classes in our dataset, called neuron types 1–4.

  . Analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes and gene ontologies revealed that LN- and skin-innervating sensory neurons differ with respect to many surface ion channels and synaptic proteins (LN-specific: Trpc4, Trpm8, Kcnh5, and Ache; skin-specific: Trpc3, Trpc6, Kctd16, Synpr, Gabra1, and Kcnk12), as well as secreted and cell surface molecules,

   To take into consideration the directionality of the cognate pairs, we partitioned ligand-receptor pairs into three categories: (1) the gene product is secreted by LN-innervating neuron, (2) secreted by LN-resident cell types, or (3) non-directional/unknown directionality, often corresponding to interactions between two membrane-tethered proteins. Considering only molecules secreted by LN-innervating neurons (category 1), LEC 2, LEC 1, BECs, HECs, and NESs expressed a significantly elevated abundance of cognate receptors (Figure 6F).

In the immune compartment, certain innate leukocytes, including neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, were also targets of optogenetically stimulated sensory fibers, whereas the bulk of adaptive lymphocytes remained essentially unaffected. Of note, a nociceptor-neutrophil communication axis has been identified recently as a major immunosuppressive mechanism in mouse models of S. aureus-induced pneumonia and S. pyogenes-induced necrotizing fasciitis (Baral et al., 2018; Pinho-Ribeiro et al., 2018).
