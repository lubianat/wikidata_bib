# Highlights
As is often the case for Wikipedians, we  found  that  the  stillbirth  page4  on  the  English  language  Wikipedia  was  missing  important  information—eg,  the  major  causes  of  stillbirth  (malaria  and  syphilis)  were  not  mentioned,  and details on epidemiological aspects were   scarce.1   Unsurprisingly,   the   Wikipedia pages on stillbirth in about 20 other languages were less detailed than  the  English  language  version.  This  worried  us  because  not  only  is  Wikipedia  the  world’s  most  used  source  of  health  information  online,  but  it  is  also  one  of  the  most  widely  used  sources  by  medical  students,  doctors,    and    other    health-care    providers.

There  is  clearly  a  huge  unmet  need  for  health-related  information,  to   the   extent   that   some   mobile   network  operators  in  LMICs  do  not  charge  for  data  costs  when  users  are  accessing Wikipedia (Wikipedia Zero8

Wikipedia  editing  with  the  goal  of  bringing  about  increased  access  to  reliable,  understandable,  and  up-to-date  health  information9in     multiple     languages.     PLoS Computational  Biology,  for  example,  encourages  its  authors  to  post  topics  on  Wikipedia.10  Promoting  inclusive  and  equitable  learning  opportunities  for all speaks to the aspirations of the Sustainable  Development  Goals.  We  suggest that medical journals actively promote  and  incentivise  Wikipedia  editing by the health-care community so  that  the  most  commonly  used  source of online health information is as reliable as possible.
