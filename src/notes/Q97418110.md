# Highlights

The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project generated a vast amount of whole-genome cancer sequencing resource data. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, which aggregated whole genome sequencing data from 2658 cancers across 38 tumor types, we provide a userâ€™s guide to the five publicly available online data exploration and visualization tools introduced in the PCAWG marker paper

The Expression Atlas focuses on RNA-seq data, supporting queries in either a baseline context (e.g., finding genes that are expressed in prostate adenocarcinoma samples) or in a differential context (e.g., finding genes that are under- or over-expressed in prostate adenocarcinomas compared to adjacent normal prostate samples).

The Chromothripsis Explorer is best for users who are looking for a global picture of somatic alterations in a tumor (e.g., large-scale aneuploidies or translocations)

Currently, Expression Atlas provides results from >3500 experiments that include about 120,000 assays from >60 different organisms. The datasets cover >100 cell types from the Cell Ontology and >700 diseases represented in the EFO.
