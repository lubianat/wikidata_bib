# Highlights


While most public repositories have firm requirements that metadata must accompany submitted datasets, the quality of those metadata is generally very poor. A key problem is that the typical metadata acquisition process is onerous and time consuming, with little interactive guidance or assistance provided to users.

We implemented our approach as a service integrated into the CEDAR Workbench metadata authoring platform, and evaluated it using metadata from two public biomedical repositories: US-based National Center for Biotechnology Information BioSample and European Bioinformatics Institute BioSamples. 

The results show that our approach is able to use analyses of previously entered metadata coupled with ontology-based mappings to present users with accurate recommendations when authoring metadata.

A typical submission requires spreadsheet-based entry of metadata—with metadata frequently spread over multiple spreadsheets—followed by manual assembly of multiple spreadsheets and raw data files into an overall submission package. Further problems occur because submission requirements are typically written at a high level of abstraction. For example, while a standard may require indicating the organism associated to a biological sample, it typically will not specify how the value of the organism must be supplied

 An example is Usher (8), which was developed to speed up form completion by analyzing previous submissions of the same form to predict likely values for fields during completion of a new form.
