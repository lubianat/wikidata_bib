# Highlights

Here we used a combination of calcium imaging and single-cell RT–PCR to identify odorant receptors (ORs) for odorants with related structures but varied odors

. For example, when the hydroxyl group of octanol is replaced by a carboxyl group to give octanoic acid, its perceived odor changes from orange and rose-like to rancid and sweaty (3). Curiously, the perceived quality of an odorant can also differ with a change in its concentration

The detection of odorants is mediated by ∼1000 different G protein–coupled odorant receptors (ORs) that are encoded by a multigene family (7, 23, 20, 28)

These studies provide evidence that the mammalian olfactory system uses a combinatorial receptor coding scheme to encode odor identity and to discriminate odors (Figure 8).
