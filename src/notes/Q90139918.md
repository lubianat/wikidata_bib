# Highlights

We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations.

cellHarmony is implemented as a python package and as an integrated workflow within the software AltAnalyze. 

Given the complexity of the analyses required to achieve these goals, automated solutions that can be applied by both experienced bioinformaticians and conventional laboratory biologists are ultimately required.

 In the case of disease, the objective of such algorithms is to annotate perturbed cell states according to their most closely related normal equivalents, without considering novel cell populations observed uniquely in disease. A number of algorithms have been recently developed to perform this objective including scmap, Seurat3, conos, Garnett, CHETAH and SingleCellNet (see Table 1 for a comparison of features and methods) (2–6).

Firstly, label projection methods are designed to explicitly align disease cell types to appropriately similar healthy states, whereas joint-clustering methods will often produce overly specialized clusters in which separate disease and healthy clusters are obtained for the same cell type (13–15).

Pre-compiled graphical user-interface distributions are provided from http://altanalyze.org and the command-line version from GitHub or via installation from PyPI.
