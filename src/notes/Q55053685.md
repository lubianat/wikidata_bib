# Highlights

We report here on our project to provide robust support for machine- resolvable, persistent compact identifiers in biomedical data citation, by harmonizing the Identifiers. org and N2T.net (Name-To-Thing) meta-resolvers and extending their capabilities.

in 2013–2014 to the development and publication of the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP) require that data become a first-class research object that is archived in persistent stores and is cited just as publications are cited, in all cases where: (1) findings or claims are based on the authors’ primary research data; or (2) data from other sources is input to the authors’ analysis.

A reasonable solution to the identifiers problem is to assign Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to identify datasets. DOIs are already widely used in the publishing world as persistent identifiers for scholarly publications. They have been adopted by generalist data repositories such as Dryad, FigShare, Zenodo and Dataverse, as well as by domain data repositories outside of biomedicine.

Identifiers.org is a type specimen of this class of service, providing several additional services beyond redirection16. It provides stable, persistent and resolvable URIs for the identification of life science (and other) data. N2T.net is another such service, with redirection targets based on both individual identifier lookup
and prefix-based lookup. 

We have implemented this approach in both the Identifiers.org resolver (https://identifiers.org), deployed at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute; and the Name-to- Thing resolver (https://n2t.net), deployed at the California Digital Library.

An example of formal referencing using a meta-resolver URL with an ArrayExpress reference is shown here: Aimone, J. B., Leasure, J. L., Perreau, V. M. & Thallmair, M. Transcription profiling of rat spinal cord contusion 35 days after injury (2012). ArrayExpress. https://identifiers.org/arrayexpress:E-GEOD-2599 (2012).

While not all publishers will be ready immediately to cite data, we believe we have substantially simplified the problem for early adopters.

--> Nice!
