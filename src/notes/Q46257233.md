# Highlights

. Here we show, using integrated imaging–genomics analyses 
of primary human fibroblasts, that upregulation of interleukin-11 
(IL-11) is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFβ1 exposure 
and required for its pro-fibrotic effect

 Therefore, inhibition of IL-11 
prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response 
to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These results reveal a 
central role of IL-11 in fibrosis and we propose that inhibition of 
IL-11 is a potential therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases.

L11 has been linked to haematopoiesis14 and tumorigenesis15, 
among other roles. In contrast to a previous cardiac study16, we found 
that recombinant human IL-11 (rhIL-11) is strongly pro-fibrotic in 
cardiac fibroblasts, increasing myofibroblasts and ECM production, 
motility, contraction and invasion (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 4). 

We  studied  the  fibrotic  response  of  cardiac  fibroblasts  from  
Il11ra1−/− mice20. TGFβ 1-induced transcriptional regulation in 
Il11ra1−/− cardiac fibroblasts was maintained and similar to that of 
Il11ra1+/+ (wild-type) cardiac fibroblasts (R2 =   0.94,  P <   2.2  ×   10−16, 
Spearman’s correlation; Extended Data Fig. 7). However, protein-based 
assays showed that cardiac fibroblasts from Il11ra1−/− mice did not 
increase synthesis of ECM proteins or become myofibroblasts upon 
stimulation (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 7), again demonstrating 
the effect of IL-11 at the protein level.
