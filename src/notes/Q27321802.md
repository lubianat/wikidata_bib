# Highlights

Single oRG cells generate hundreds of daughter cells of diverse types
•
Molecular profile suggests that oRG cells sustain proliferative niche in primate OSVZ


These results suggest that outer radial glia directly support the subventricular niche through local production of growth factors, potentiation of growth factor signals by extracellular matrix proteins, and activation of self-renewal pathways, thereby enabling the developmental and evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex.

To analyze molecular features of cells in the germinal zones during human cortical neurogenesis, we captured single cells from microdissected VZ and SVZ specimens of human cortex at gestational weeks 16–18 (GW16–18) and generated sequencing libraries (schematic Figure 1A).
