# Highlights

von Economo neurons (VENs) are bipolar, spindle-shaped neurons restricted to layer 5 of
human frontoinsula and anterior cingulate cortex that appear to be selectively vulnerable to
neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases

Cross-species alignment of this cell cluster with a well-annotated mouse
classiﬁcation shows strong homology to extratelencephalic (ET) excitatory neurons that
project to subcerebral targets

In humans, they are
restricted to the anterior cingulate (ACC), frontoinsular (FI), and
medial frontopolar regions of cerebral cortex

Fork cells, another
distinctive morphologically-deﬁned neuron type, are often found
in the same brain regions as VENs and are similarly characterized
by a single large basal dendrite, but differ from VENs by having
a divided apical dendrite

VENs and fork cells appear to be
selectively vulnerable neuron types, as loss of these cells has
been observed in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
(bvFTD) 15–17 . Loss of VENs has also been observed in several
neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia 18 and suici-
dal psychosis 19 , as well as in autism 20 , agenesis of the corpus
callosum 21 , and possibly Alzheimer’s disease

For example, a recent
study using in situ hybridization (ISH) data from the Allen Human
Brain Atlas identiﬁed ADRA1A, GABRQ, and VMAT2 as VEN
marker genes

VENs have also been reported to express ser-
otonin receptor 2B (HTR2B) 26 , dopamine receptor D3 (DRD3) 26 ,
and the Schizophrenia-associated protein DISC1 4,27 . Additionally,
they express transcription factors FEZF2 and CTIP2 28 , which are
required for generating subcortical projection neurons in mice

We
identify many novel markers for this cluster and demonstrate
that they are co-expressed in a combination of pyramidal neu-
rons, VENs, and fork cells

Transcriptomic cell types in layer 5 of FI
dentifying a transcriptomic cell type corresponding to VENs.
To characterize each transcriptomic type and determine whether
one might represent VENs, we examined selective marker genes
for each excitatory cluster (the top four markers per cluster are
shown in Fig. 1d)
