# Highlights
Objective
To conduct a comprehensive review of peer-reviewed, published literature to learn what the existing body of literature says about Wikipedia as a health information resource and what publication trends exist, if any.

The literature positions Wikipedia as a prominent health information resource in various contexts for the public, patients, students, and practitioners seeking health information online. Wikipedia’s health content is accessed frequently, and its pages regularly rank highly in Google search results. While Wikipedia itself is well into its second decade, the academic discourse around Wikipedia within the context of health is still young and the academic literature is limited when attempts are made to understand Wikipedia as a health information resource. Possibilities for future research will be discussed.

With respect to adult education, continuing education, or professional practice (S4 Appendix, Table 7), Lieberthal and Leon (2015) report on having adult health economics students post their written assignments to Wikipedia [52]. Additionally, genomics experts use and contribute to the GeneWiki, a collection of Wikipedia entries where each entry is related to a specific human gene, which aims to comprehensively annotate gene functions for each known human gene [70]. The GeneWiki has been integrated into the larger body of Wikipedia articles [70] and is presented as a solution to the previous problem biomedical researchers faced in producing review articles for each of the 20,000 human genes [71]. Further, the GeneWiki itself has been mined for its gene annotations in an effort to generate a gene ontology and a disease ontology [72]. Finally, a study from New Zealand, while citing a low participation rate, suggests that Wikipedia use by interns, residents, and consultants is common to aid with memory recall or to provide a fast overview [73].


Any evaluation will remain a snapshot in time that may or may not be applicable by the time the study hits the press. Unless these studies are used to establish a plan to improve Wikipedia’s content, it is a challenge to understand their value. Studies that measure the quality of Wikipedia’s health information seem to be asking the wrong question. A more appropriate question might be “how can Wikipedia’s health information be improved?” Further, recommendations for or against the use of Wikipedia in any context based on quality do not take Wikipedia’s utility in education or research under consideration


An interesting contradiction in the literature however, is that some studies find Wikipedia is appropriate for public consumption, while others deem it unsuitable for student consumption This raises the question: what makes Wikipedia suitable for patient use, but not medical student use? If the Wikipedia community aims to create a Wikipedia that is suitable for both medical students and patients, what problems may arise?

Shafee et al (2017) believe that “Wikipedia is set to retain its position as a key public health information resource” [14] and they issue a call for participation to the medical community, as do their peers [13,25,33], “to ensure that medical content is accurate in the world’s most consulted encyclopedia” [14].
