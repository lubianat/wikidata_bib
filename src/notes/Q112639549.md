# Highlights

Here, we developed a deep learning-based frame with a design visible, DCNet, that embeds the relationships between cells and their marker genes in the neural network, and can infer the cell landscape with more than 400 cell types based on bulk RNA-seq data. DCNet accurately recapitulated the cell landscape of multiple single cell RNA-seq datasets, which showed better robustness and stability. 

n this study, we present DCNet, an interpretable deep learning method, that embeds the relationships between 434 cell types and their marker genes into the structure of the ANN. It can identify the cell landscapes with better robustness and accuracy than other methods such as TIMER.

According to the relationships among cell types, the hierarchical structure of cell types in the patient TME was built, which bases on OBO database (Cell Ontology database) and CellMarker database [Supplementary Table 1], and 434 cells all located on the leaf node.
