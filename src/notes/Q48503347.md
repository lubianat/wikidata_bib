A standard nomenclature for referencing and authentication of pluripotent stem cells.

# Highlights

To avoid ambiguities in PSC-line referencing, we strongly urge pub- lishers to demand registration and use of the standard name when publishing research based on hPSC lines.

The low community penetration of this first nomenclature proposal resulted in reality in the continuing lack of a standard unique identifier or name.

--> Nice!

CRL2429 fibroblasts from the American Type Culture Collection or line BJ provided by Stemgent have been used by many laboratories to generate iPSC lines, each assigned with a different name suggestive of unrelatedness.

In the Cellosaurus database (http://web.expasy.org/ cellosaurus/), 15.1% of the 6,252 listed hPSC lines have multiple synonyms and 49.5% have at least one additional synonym.

To implement an UI, we propose to modify the previously pro- posed nomenclature for hPSCs (Luong et al., 2011) and adapt the recommended nomenclature system of the Inter- national Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) (http://iclac.org/resources/cell-line-names/). The modified nomenclature uses the previously proposed identifier for cell source, cell line, and cell type and complements this with codification of relatedness of a given hPSC line to its origin and its genetically modified derivatives (Table 2).

For validation of names, a semantic uniform resource locator (URL) for every registered and validated cell line is provided. This simple yet semantically meaningful system for information retrieval improves cell line identifi- cation and reduces syntax ambiguities. The URLs are persistent and will not change over time, allowing their use as uniform resource identifiers in an application ontology.
