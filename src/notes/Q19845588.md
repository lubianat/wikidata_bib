# Highlights

The Open Pharmacological Concepts Triple Store (Open PHACTS) is anInnovative Medicines Initiative project that uses semantic web technologyapproaches to enable scientists to easily access and process data from multiplesources to solve real-world drug discovery problems

 For example,an integrated and comprehensive interface to publicly available pharmacology,physicochemical and biomolecular data could support initial drug screeningstages and limit expensive late-stage trial failure. Such tools would also beinvaluable to academia and small to medium enterprises (SMEs), which havehistorically enjoyed little access to proprietary integrated platforms.

 --> 1.3.2.3. Bio2RDF and semantic databases

We describe how the platform can be used to solve common queriesthat require linkage of the entities of targets, compounds, and pathways, using theexamples of a single target, Dopamine Receptor D2, and two well curatedpathways of therapeutic interest from the public resource WikiPathways 

--> cool

The Open PHACTS Discovery Platform makes available the data needed toanswer a wide range of questions applicable to pharmaceutical research by broadlycovering critical aspects of chemistry and biology. A multitude of potential usecases of the Open PHACTS Discovery Platform can be envisaged: targetidentification and validation, discovery of interaction profiles of compounds andtargets, detection of potential toxic interactions, repositioning of existing drugs tonew therapeutic areas, and many other drug discovery question

--> I guess Wikidata fills a lot of that role too.

The workflows developed for the present use cases can be broadly used by drugdiscovery scientists to exploit the wealth of publicly available information forother targets and pathways of interest.

Going forward, thecontinuation of the infrastructure development and data integration will becarried out in the context of the Open PHACTS Foundation (http://www.openphactsfoundation.org)

--> Website is up, but it seems that the foundation is not that active...
