Single-cell RNAseq cell cluster labelling by reference (celaref)
================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q104552099]  

The annotation of the ‘cell type’ of each cluster is performed by a domain expert biologist 

A list of ‘Up’ genes are extracted for each query cluster. Then, those genes are looked up in the ranking of genes in each reference cell cluster. 

There can be none, one or multiple reference group similarities for the query group.
 
### Comments
Uses a lot of p values, but null hypothesis are not clear. The word "null" is not mentioned once.
