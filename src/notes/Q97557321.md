# Highlights

•
Establishment of a database for clinical studies based on pluripotent stem cells
•
54 clinical studies identified from public sources

Having studied research trends in the field of hPSCs over the past 15 years (Guhr et al., 2006, Guhr et al., 2018; Kobold et al., 2015; Löser et al., 2010, Löser et al., 2012), we were now interested in tracing the latest developments of translating hPSC research to the clinic. 

To define clinical features and cell types, ontologies are used, including Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology, Disease Ontology, and Experimental Factor Ontology for clinical features, as well as Cell Ontology and Foundational Model of Anatomy for cells or anatomic locations.
