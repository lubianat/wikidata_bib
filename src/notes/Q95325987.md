# Highlights

They show that T cellactivation occurs at the tumor followingrecruitment from lymph nodes and revealthe presence of three dynamic stromalpopulations that display uniquefunctional propertie


Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we examine the stromal compartment in murine melanoma and drain-ing lymph nodes (LNs) at points across tumor development, providing data at http://www.teichlab.org/data/.

 Complement component C3 is specifically expressed in the im-mune population. Its cleavage product C3a supports the recruitment of C3aR+macrophages, and perturbationof C3a and C3aR disrupts immune infiltration, slowing tumor growth

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the most abundantstromal component, secreting growth factors, promoting angio-genesis, facilitating metastasis, and regulating immune infiltra-tion 


--> CD45- / CD31- --> Fibroblasts! Not only, I guess

To avoid the biases associated with the isolationof stromal cells, we also injected B16-F10 melanoma cells intoCAG-EGFP mice, which exhibit widespread EGFP expression.This enabled a negative selection approach, which did not relyupon the expression of surface markers. Tumor and immunecells were removed by selecting GFP+CD45cells only, withthe remaining stromal cells separated into CD31+blood andlymphatic endothelial cells and CD31stromal populations. Sin-gle cells were isolated from two animals per time point and pro-filed using Smart-seq2 (Figures 1A andS1B).

 cDC1 and cDC2. cDC1and cDC2 titles were assigned based on the expression ofknown  markers,  includingCd11c,Clec9a,Baft3(cDC1),Cd11b,Fcgr1, andSirpa(cDC2) (

   T cell populations from tumors and draining LNs were alsotranscriptionally distinct, clustering based upon their subtypeand location (Figure 3A).

A subset of the potentially exhausted CD8+T cellsalso showed the expression of Entpd1 (CD39), which wasrecently identified as a marker to distinguish tumor-specificand bystander CD8+T cells 

We identified three distinct CD31stromal populations, referredto as Stromal 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 4A;Table S3). The expression ofcommonly used mesenchymal markers confirmed this identity,but as expected, individual markers were extremely variablefrom cell to cell and across clusters (Figures 4B andS3A). How-ever, marker combinations could be associated with particularclusters. Stromal 1(S1) was distinguished from S3 by high levelsofPdpn, Pdgfra, andCd34, whileActa2(aSMA) was strongly ex-pressed by the latter. S2 represented an intermediate populationthat expressedPdpnandPdgfra, yet displayed low expressionofActa2andCd34(Figure 4B).

S1 (PdpnhighPdgfrahighCd34high)
S2 (PdpnhighPdgfrahighCd34low)upregulated genesencoding extracellular matrix (ECM) components, includingnumerous collagen family members such asPostnandTnc
S3 (Acta2high) likely repre-sents a more contractile stromal subset, expressing genesinvolved in the regulation and rearrangement of the actin cyto-skeleton. In particular, this cluster upregulatedRock1,Mlc2,andMlck, which are responsible for the contraction of actinstress fibers. While all three stromal populations expressedfibroblast markers, indicating that they represent melanomaCAFs, S3 also expressed some pericyte-associated markerssuch asCspg4(Ng2),Mcam, andRgs5(Figure S3C). 

While NG2+andaSMA+cells were observed surrounding vessels in adjacentskin, they were less frequently associated with intratumoralvessels. Furthermore, both markers could be detected in peritu-moral spindle-shaped cells that are distinct from the vasculature(Figures S4A and S4B). Thus, the precise cellular identity of S3remains elusive and may represent both pericytes associatedwith the vasculature and more fibroblast-like cells that are disso-ciated from vessels.

In our hands, few bone marrow-derived stromal cells (GFP+) were detected, suggesting a negli-gible influence on the tumor stromal niche in this model.

--> I really like this "In our hands" construct

The emergence ofscRNA-seq has enabled deeper insights into tumor biology,revealing the true degree of intratumoral heterogeneity, notdetectable by previous methods (Costa et al., 2018; Elyadaet al., 2019; Puram et al., 2017; Tirosh et al., 2016).

While this could imply pericyte contamination, S3also produced significant amounts of matrix components suchasCol1a1,Col1a2(collagen1),Fn1(fibronectin1), andSparc,which are strongly indicative of a fibroblast phenotype. Hence,S3 may embody a mixed population of mesenchymal cells thatshare similar surface marker expression and functional proper-ties. Alternatively, fibroblasts within S3 may be derived from peri-cyte populations, as has been observed during fibrosis andtumor development, in which pericytes dissociate from vesselsand adopt a myofibroblast phenotype (Chen et al., 2011; Hosakaet al., 2016; Lin et al., 2008; Mederacke et al., 2013),
