# Highlights

used to retrieve and process information from databases saved in Resource
Description Framework (RDF) format. Here, we introduce four aspects of Wikidata that enable it to serve as a knowledge base
for general information on the COVID-19 pandemic: its flexible data model, its multilingual features, its alignment to multiple
external databases, and its multidisciplinary organization. The rich knowledge graph created for COVID-19 in Wikidata can be
visualized, explored and analyzed, for purposes like decision support as well as educational and scholarly research.


This community-centric approach is both a
blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it makes
methodical planning of the whole structure and its
granularity very difficult, if not impossible [22]: there
simply is no central coordination system, and all
major design decisions have to be approved through
a consensus of all interested contributors. On the
other hand, harnessing knowledge and skills of a
broad range of human and automated contributors
provides for an unparalleled flexibility and versatility
of uses, and allows for rapid addressing of emerging
and urgent phenomena, such as disease outbreaks
