# Highlights

 From its creation until 2020, FANTOM6 has contributed to the research community a large dataset generated from the knock-down of 285 lncRNAs in human dermal fibroblasts; this is followed with extensive expression profiling and cellular phenotyping. Other updates to the FANTOM resource includes the reprocessing of the miRNA and promoter atlases of human, mouse and chicken with the latest reference genome assemblies

 s. Recently, the sixth edition of FANTOM (FANTOM6) was launched to elucidate the biological functions of lncRNAs (8). LncRNAs constitute a major fraction of the transcriptome and can be broadly categorized into sense-intronic, antisense, intergenic, divergent and enhancer RNA regions (2). 

 Functional annotation of 285 lncRNAs in human fibroblast cells
The major goal of FANTOM6 is to systematically elucidate the function of lncRNAs in the human genome. For this, we used LNA antisense GapmeR technology to suppress the expression levels of a set of known and novel lncRNAs (7) in different cell types.

The update includes additional annotations of cancer cell line samples based on NCI Thesaurus (https://ncit.nci.nih.gov/), as well as refined annotations of cell and tissue samples based on Cell Ontology (28) and UBERON (29) respectively.
