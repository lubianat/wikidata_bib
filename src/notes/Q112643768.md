# Highlights

s. We developed a single-cell method of intrinsic subtype classification (SCSubtype) to reveal recurrent neoplastic cell heterogeneity. Immunophenotyping using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) provides high-resolution immune profiles, including new PD-L1/PD-L2+ macrophage populations associated with clinical outcome

Using single-cell signatures, we deconvoluted large breast cancer cohorts to stratify them into nine clusters, termed ‘ecotypes’, with unique cellular compositions and clinical outcomes. 

 This results in three broad subtypes that correlate with prognosis and define treatment strategies: luminal (ER+, PR+/−); HER2+ (HER2+, ER+/−, PR+/−); and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC; ER−, PR−, HER2−). 

 SCSubtype revealed that 13 out of 20 samples had less than 90% of neoplastic cells falling under 1 molecular subtype, while only 1 tumor (CID3921; HER2E) showed a completely homogenous molecular subtype (Fig. 2b). 

  Notably, we identified two new macrophage populations (LAM1:FABP5/c1 and LAM2:APOE/c2) outside of the conventional M1/M2 classification that comprised 30–40% of total myeloid cells

  . Cell types were associated with their appropriate pathological annotation (Fig. 6b).
