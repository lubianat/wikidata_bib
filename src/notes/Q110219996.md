# Highlights

Presented here is a collection of data snapshots which demonstrate model outputs of queries to the data which WikiProject Clinical Trials has curated in Wikidata.

Beyond what these queries actually report, persons familiar with the field of clinical research are able to look at this information and consider the origins of some of it, note what data is here that would be difficult to find elsewhere, and also to imagine what data would be useful here but which is absent.

We share these datasets because reproducing the state of Wikidata for past times is difficult, and wish to report these results as a milestone of our progress till now.

These datasets were collected 19 December 2021. See the original queries in WikiProject Clinical Trials.
