Geospatial data and Scholia
===========================
  
  [@wikidata:Q50813856]  
  
Publication date : 18 of March, 2018  

# Highlights
Scholia presents bibliographic and scientific information in so-called aspects, e.g., for a work, an
author, an organization, a sponsor, a publisher, or a topic.
The aspect is part of the URL. For example, http://tools.wmflabs.org/
scholia/topic/ is the prefix for the topic aspect, which includes subtopics.
A particular Wikidata item may be viewed in one or more of these aspects:
by default a university will be displayed as an organization, but can also be
viewed as a sponsor, as a topic, or as a publisher

Magnus Manske has built several tools utilizing the geospatial data in Wikidata.
His Reasonator (https://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/) shows OpenStreetMap maps if a queried item has geographic coordinates. The wikidata-todo
tool (https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-todo) can show Wikidata items
on a map around a queried geographic coordinate. His mobile app WikiShootMe!
(https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikishootme/) identifies nearby places having
a Wikidata item but no associated image.

We have introduced two new Scholia aspects of particular geospatial relevance:
country and location. The country aspect shows information with respect to a
country. For instance, /scholia/country/Q35 is the country aspect for Denmark.
Currently, this aspect shows a list of academic organizations in the country and
a list of authors associated with these organizations

4 User stories
Below, we present five realistic user stories and show how they can be handled
with Scholia. Their usefulness should increase as Wikidata coverage improves.
1. You are to review research applications from Finland about machine learning
and related research fields. You are based outside Finland and would like to
get an overview of Finnish researchers and research organizations in that
research area, their works as well as their collaboration and citation patterns

Scholia can present an overview of Finnish machine learning with
the country–topic subaspect at https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/
country/Q33/topic/Q2539. The current page shows a list with 19 authors,
with the most prolific author, Erkki Oja, listed with 5 works. The co-author
graph shows one connected component, while the co-citation graph is empty.
More dense graphs can be observed for Denmark.

You are a researcher interested in Wikipedia research and planning a visit to
T¨ubingen where you would like to meet other Wikipedia researchers.
This user story is basically the same as the above, but with T¨ubingen
(Q3806) instead of Copenhagen and Wikipedia (Q52) in place of machine
learning: https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/location/Q3806/topic/
Q52

--> Nice format, user stories.

We note that the query associated with the first user story about Finnish
machine learning researchers works without geospatial data and uses hierarchical
relationships between administrative territorial entities instead. Both approaches
could be combined in further queries, since Wikidata also links those administrative entities with geospatial data
