# Highlights

t is estimated that the cumulative economic burden of OA in Canada from 2010 to 2015 was $195 billion and annual costs are expected to rise in the future2.

The menisci are integral to joint homeostasis by decreasing contact stresses5, increasing stability6 and aiding joint lubrication7. These complex functions are facilitated by the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is produced and maintained by a heterogenous population of cells in the menisci, the predominance of which are referred to as meniscus fibrochondrocytes (MFCs)
