  [@wikidata:Q104626424]  

# Highlights

We used FOntCell to fuse CELDA, LifeMap and LungMAP Human Anatomy cell ontologies to produce comprehensive cell ontology.

Author Summary There is a strong belief in the research community that there exist more cell types than the described in the literature, therefore new technologies were developed to produce a high volume of data to discover new cells. 

One issue that arises once the cells are discovered is how to classify them. One way to perform such classification is to use already existing cell classifications from different ontology sources but it is difficult to merge them. 

We developed a new Python module, FOntCell that merges efficiently cell ontologies.

To decrease the human involvement to a minimum in the merging of new cell ontologies, we developed an algorithm and implemented it as a software package in Python, FOntCell, for automatic fusion of ontologies

LifeMap provides contrasted data and enough cell types to be fused synergistically with CELDA, both ontologies containing cell types missing in the other. An issue arising when fusing CELDA and LifeMap is their different labelling systems. The two ontologies use different labels to name same cell types, thus, a simple word matching cannot find equivalences. Therefore, it is necessary to align ontologies

One of the applications of FOntCell is to merge an ontology from a broad, general description, with an ontology with very specific knowledge within the same knowledge domain. We used this functionality to merge the already merged CELDA+LifeMap with the Cell Ontology for Human Lung Maturation (LMHA) from LungMAP, i.e. a specific ontology of cells for lung development starting ~36 weeks of human fetal gestation and continuing after birth with some variation in when the alveolar stage commences and when it is complete. The .owl file used in the merging was generated by the LungMAP Consortium [U01HL122642] and downloaded from (www.lungmap.net), on April 7, 2018

The FOntCell software package, written as a Python module is available at https://pypi.org/project/fontcell/, and the resulting fusion of CELDA and LifeMap cell ontologies in OWL format at https://gitlab.com/JavierCabau/fontcell
