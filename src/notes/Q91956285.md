# Highlights

We present a document classification scheme aiming to identify papers containing information relevant to a specific topic, among a large collection of articles, for supporting the biocuration classification task. 

s part of the MGI literature classification pipeline, GXD curators identify MGI-selected papers that are relevant for GXD. The dataset consists of ~60 000 documents (5469 labeled as relevant; 52 866 as irrelevant), gathered throughout 2012–2016, in which each document is represented by the text of its title, abstract and figure captions.

Our classifier clearly showed improved performance by utilizing information from captions, titles and abstracts (0.876 precision, 0.829 recall and 0.852 f-measure) compared to using title and abstract alone (~0.770 precision, recall and f-measure).

To reduce the number of features, we first identify all gene, enzyme, protein, mutation and anatomy concepts using the publicly available biomedical annotation tools Pubtator (30) and BeCAS (21). We then substitute all gene and protein concepts by the generic term PRGE, while the specific mentions of enzyme, mutation and anatomy are similarly replaced by the generic term ENZI, MUTN and ANAT, respectively
