# Highlights

A curated collection and summary of deregulated lncRNAs in cancer is essential to thoroughly understand the mechanisms and functions of lncRNAs. Here, we developed the Lnc2Cancer database, which contains 1057 manually curated associations between 531 lncRNAs and 86 human cancers

The Cancer Genome Atlas (17), provide an opportunity to investigate cancer-related lncRNAs in a large sample (18,19). 

For example, COSMIC (23) collects cancer genes and mutations, MethyCancer (24) and PubMeth (25) aim to investigate DNA methylation in cancer, and miRCancer (26) provides literature-supported microRNA and cancer associations; however, no resource is currently devoted to collecting the latest and experimentally supported lncRNA-cancer associations.


Second, we extracted experimentally supported lncRNA-cancer associations ‘by hand,’ that is, by manually curating from published papers.
