# Highlights

—there are currently >2.1 billion species occurrence records in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, representing a 12-fold increase since 2007 [2]. This rise in biodiversity data is due in part to the growing popularity of citizen, or community-based, science.

One of the most globally successful platforms is iNaturalist (www.inaturalist.org; [3])—a multitaxa platform and joint initiative of the California Academy of Sciences and the National Geographic Society. 

An observation is deemed “Research Grade” when it meets the site’s metadata quality criteria, and has 2 or more suggested identifications, more than two-thirds of which agree at a species level (i.e., 2/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc.; although records identified to a level finer than family can also become Research Grade if no further progress in identification is deemed possible).

1. Your contributions increase knowledge of biodiversity

2. The value of opportunistic records is increasing

3. You can contribute data on threatened, data-deficient, or invasive species

4. iNaturalist is a ready-made, free, and easy-to-use data collection infrastructure

5. You can partake in dynamic, real-time interactions around the world

6. You can engage with a broader audience

7. You can enjoy yourself

 while the project First Known Photographs of Living Specimens has more than 3,600 records representing the first, and often only, photographic records of those taxa [10].

 A consistent thread across many of these “special” records is that, until seen and identified by an expert, they are just another record among the millions uploaded to the platform. 

 . We conclude by offering an open invitation to all prospective identifiers to reach out to us on iNaturalist for any advice or guidance (see S1 Table).

 A table of the authors’ iNaturalist handles for those interested in reaching out to the authors on the iNaturalist platform.
