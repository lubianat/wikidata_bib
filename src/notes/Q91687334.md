# Highlights
Recent advances in microscopy, mass spectrometry, artificial intelligence, sequencing, and nanotechnology make this the right time for the creation of a PCA initiative.

Cells were first described in slices of cork by Robert Hooke in 1665 [2]. Nearly 200 years later, Schleiden’s and Schwann’s investigations of plant and animal microanatomy [3, 4] led to the theory that these cells were in fact the fundamental organizational units of life [5]. 

The dynamic, spatiotemporal information contained in the Human Mitotic Cell Atlas [8] is one potential model.

In addition, a Cell Atlas can provide insights into how viral or bacterial pathogens change cell properties, addressing crucial issues such as how to minimize herbivory and pathogens in stressful environments?

If combined with cell type-specific expression, this technique could also enable determination of organelle proteomes by cell type or even cell state. Building maps of protein localization together with interaction data will be strongly synergistic and mutually reinforcing.
