# Highlights

Mouse heart development arises fromMesp1-expressing cardiovascular progenitors(CPs) that are specified during gastrulation. The molecular processes that control earlyregional and lineage segregation of CPs have been unclear

Single-cell transcriptome analysisofMesp1-deficient CPs showed that Mesp1 is required for the exit from the pluripotentstate and the induction of the cardiovascular gene expression program. 


Heart development begins atgastrulation, during which CPs leave the prim-itive streak (PS) and migrate toward the antero-lateral pole of the embryo (2). From embryonicday 6.25 (E6.25) to E7.25,Mesp1marks the earlyCPs within the PS, whereas a day later,Mesp1isexpressed in the somites (


To investigate the molecular and cellular basisof the earliest stages of CP specification and di-versification, we performed single-cell RNA se-quencing (scRNA-seq) ofMesp1CPs at E6.75and E7.25. 

SPRING analysis, which allows visualizinghigh-dimensional single-cell expression data (14),of WTMesp1-expressing cells at E6.75 and E7.25identified five distinct destination cell types(DCTs) protruding from a core of intermingledcells (Fig. 3, A and B). All cells present withinthe DCTs came from E7.25 embryos, which isconsistent with cell fate diversification ofMesp1-derived lineages during the late stages of gastru-lation.
