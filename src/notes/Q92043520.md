# Highlights

Discovery studies in animals constitute a cornerstone of biomedical research, but suffer from lack of generalizability to human populations. We propose that large-scale interrogation of these data could reveal patterns of animal use that could narrow the translational divide. We describe a text-mining approach that extracts translationally useful data from PubMed abstracts. These comprise six modules: species, model, genes, interventions/disease modifiers, overall outcome and functional outcome measures

e aspects of the tool are generalizable, whereas others are field-specific. In the initial version presented here, we demonstrate proof of concept within a single disease area, Parkinsonâ€™s disease. However, the program can be expanded in modular fashion to support a wider range of neurodegenerative diseases.

 Each module extracts relevant information from a list of abstracts and the results are stored in a relational database (MySQL) for various types of analyses
