# Highlights
e identified more than 50 different cell states in the human thymus. Human thymus cell states dynamically change in abundance and gene expression profiles across development and during pediatric and adult life.

mong thymic unconventional T cells, we noted a distinct subset of CD8αα+ T cells, which is marked by GNG4 expression and located in the perimedullary region of the thymus. This subset expressed high levels of XCL1 and colocalized with XCR1+ dendritic cells

We performed scRNA-seq on 15 prenatal thymi ranging from 7 PCW (post-conception weeks), when the thymic rudiment can be dissected, to 17 PCW, when thymic development is complete 

We annotated cell clusters into more than 40 different cell types or cell states (Fig. 1, C and D, and tables S2 and S3)

--> nice! 3.1. Cell-type markers in Wikidata

 Unconventional T cells have been suggested to require agonist selection for development (3). In support of this, we observed a lower ratio of nonproductive TCR chains for these cells, implying that they reside longer in the thymus than do conventional T cells (Fig. 3C).
