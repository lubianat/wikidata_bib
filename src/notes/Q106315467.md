# Highlights

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was found in diverse epithelial and immune cell types, accompanied by dramatic transcriptomicchanges within virus-positive cells. Systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, mainly by megakaryocytes andmonocytes in the peripheral blood, may contribute to the cytokine storms frequently observed in severe pa-tients

B) Overview of the cell clusters in the integrated single-cell transcriptomes of 1,462,702 cells derived from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Clusters werenamed based on the cluster-specific gene expression patterns, in which we used ‘‘high’’ or ‘‘low’’ labels to indicate the relative expression levels in the corre-sponding clusters. Genes without high or low labels were specifically expressed in the corresponding clusters.

o characterize the immune properties of COVID-19, we formeda Single Cell Consortium for COVID-19 in China (SC4), whichconsisted of researchers from 39 institutes or hospitals fromdifferent regions of China. SC4 generated a scRNA-seq datasetfor 171 COVID-19 patients, including 22 patients with mild ormoderate symptoms, 54 hospitalized patients with severe symp-toms, and 95 recovered convalescent persons (57 with mild ormoderate symptoms and 38 with severe symptoms), as well as25 healthy controls according to the WHO classification (Fig-ure 1A;Table S1).

or T cells, diverse proliferative T cell subsets, marked by highlevels ofMKI67, exhibited distinct associations with COVID-19severity and stage (Figure 2A)

We compared the inflammatory and cyto-kine scores among all of the cell subtypes captured in BALF.No enrichment of cytokine genes was observed in epithelialcells, while subtypes of macrophages and monocytes had thehighest cytokine and inflammatory scores in the progression (se-vere) samples (Figure 7A)
