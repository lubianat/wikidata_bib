# Highlights

Gastruloids are three-dimensional aggregates of embryonic stem cells that display key features of mammalian development after implantation, including germ-layer specification and axial organization


This study thus shows the power of gastruloids as a model system for exploring development and somitogenesis in vitro in a high-throughput manner.

To extend this characterization to the single-cell level, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to 25,202 cells obtained from 100 gastruloids at 120 h after aggregation that were generated using the mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines E14-IB10 or LfngT2AVenus.


A comparison between both ES cell lines revealed that some cell types are more prevalent in one of the two lines (Extended Data Fig. 1e, Supplementary Tables 1, 4), which indicates that genetic background can skew the cell-type composition of gastruloids.


Using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we demonstrate that gene expression in mouse gastruloids is very similar to embryos
