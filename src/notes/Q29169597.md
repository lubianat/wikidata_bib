# Highlights
We  have  developed  a  fast  dictionary-based  named entity recognition system, which is used for both real-time and bulk processing of text in a  variety  of  biomedical  web  resources.  We  propose  to  adapt  the  system  to  make  it interoperable with the PubAnnotation and Open Annotation standards.

The  real-time  tagger  can  be  accessed  via  standard  HTTP  requests  with  the  following  syntax: http://tagger.jensenlab.org/{method}?document={text}&entity_types={types}&...,  where {method}is  either GetEntitiesor GetHTML, {text}is  the  plain  or  HTML-formatted text  to  beprocessed,  and {types}specifies  the  types  of  entities  to  be  tagged.  These  and additional optional parameters are explained in more detail in Table 1.


ur  plan  for  the hackathon is to address this shortcoming in a manner that makes the real-time  tagger  provide automatic  annotations  according  to  the  PubAnnotation  (20,21)  standard  and,  if  time  permits, also the  the Open Annotation (19) standard. In the case of the pre-tagged corpora, we plan to make these available alsoin PubAnnotation format.


# Comments

API seems to be working nicely:
