# Highlights

In the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB), publications providing evidence for a specific protein annotation entry are organized across different categories, such as function, interaction and expression, based on the type of data they contain

The main challenge of categorizing publications at the accession annotation level is that the same publication can be annotated with multiple proteins and thus be associated with different category sets according to the evidence provided for the protein. 
 We propose a model that divides the document into parts containing and not containing evidence for the protein annotation.

We believe that such an approach could be used to systematically categorize the computationally mapped bibliography in UniProtKB, which represents a significant set of the publications, and help curators to decide whether a publication is relevant for further curation for a protein accession.

To classify publications into the UniProtKB protein entry categories, we developed a text mining pipeline based on a CNN model, so-called UPCLASS

For example, for the accession number O95997, we search in the publication sentences for the strings ‘PTTG1_HUMAN’ (accession), ‘Securin’ (recommended name), ‘Esp1-associated protein’ (alternative name), ‘Pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 protein’ (alternative name), ‘Tumor-transforming protein 1’ (short name), ‘hPTTG’ (short name), ‘PTTG1’ (gene name), ‘EAP1’ (gene synonym), ‘PTTG’ (gene synonym) and ‘TUTR1’ (gene synonym). If at least one match is found, the sentence is added to the positive pool.

Finally, performance analyses according to annotated organism show that better prediction outcomes are mostly a result of high-performing class annotations being concentrated on some organisms. Thus, it seems that the classification precision for organisms is not related to the way they are curated.

In UniProtKB, a single article can be annotated for many proteins, sometimes with the same class; hence, the prediction results are not independent, biasing the assessment. We tried to mitigate this issue by creating a test set with unique ‘document → categories’ pairs; however, examples in this set still cannot be considered as fully independent, as one document can be associated with class sub-sets, e.g. PMID → [Function] and PMID → [Function, Sequences].
