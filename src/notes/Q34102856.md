# Highlights

ystem-focused projects, such as the Renal and Cardiovascular GO Annotation Initiatives,aim to provide detailed GO data for proteins implicated in specific organ development and function. Such projects supportthe rapid evaluation of new experimental data and aid in the generation of novel biological insights to help alleviate humandisease. This paper describes the improvement of GO data for renal and cardiovascular research communities anddemonstrates that the cardiovascular-focused GO annotations, created over the past three years, have led to an evidentimprovement of microarray interpretation

--> 1.3.1.1 Gene Ontology

For  example,  the  human  proteinWNT7A  (www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/GProtein?ac = O00755)  hasbeen   annotated   with   the   electronic   InterPro2GO   annotationGO:0007275,   ‘multicellular organismal development’,   however,   themanual annotation effort has been able to additionally assign themore descriptive terms GO:0050768, ‘negative regulation of neurogen-esis’  and  GO:0051965,  ‘positive regulation of synaptogenesis’,  to  thisprotein.

--> Quite cool


The   Cardiovascular   and   Renal   GO   Annotation   Initiativeapproaches   have   been   able   to   supply   high-quality,   detailedannotations  and  specific  GO  terms.


Any  biological  community  group  who  would  be  interested  insupporting  the  improved  annotation  of  their  area  of  expertiseshould contact the authors, or members of the GO Consortium, todiscuss the options available

--> That is a huge initial step!
