# Highlights

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects a large number of military personnel and civilians. Regenerating inner-ear cochlear hair cells (HCs) is a promising strategy to restore hearing after NIHL

Highlights: â€¢    Spontaneous and forced hair cell regeneration occurs in mammalian cochleae in vivo; 

Unfortunately, humans and other mature mammals cannot replace lost HCs in the organ of Corti, so the loss of HCs can lead to permanent deafness


Apart from the SC proliferation for HC regeneration, some neonatal SCs can themselves be regenerated after damage (Mellado Lagarde et al., 2014). Inner phalangeal cells (IPhCs) and inner border cells (IBCs) (Fig. 1) can be regenerated, after toxin-induced autonomous cell loss, 
via the direct conversion of neighboring SCs in the GER regions medial to IPhCs/IBCs (Mellado Lagarde et al., 2014), 

Recently, the application of single-cell PCR and RNA-seq has allowed the high-resolution analysis of different cochlear cell populations. For example, Waldhaus et al. compared apical inner pillar cells (IPCs) and outer pillar cells (OPCs) (Fig. 1) and revealed that decreased Notch signaling and increased Wnt signaling may account for the different potencies of IPCs and OPCs for regeneration(Waldhaus et al., 2015)

# Comments
Very nice cell diagram of the cochlea. Used to clarify https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q66572837 .
