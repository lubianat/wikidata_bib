Enabling Open Science: Wikidata for Research (Wiki4R)

# Highlights

Wiki4R will therefore integrate Wikidata, the multilingual semantic backbone behind Wikipedia, into existing research processes to enable transdisciplinary research and reduce fragmentation of research in and outside Europe.

a research proposal that was submitted on January 14, 2015, to the European Commission's H2020-EINFRA-2015-1 call for proposals for e-Infrastructures for virtual research environments (VRE).

Apart from project management (WP 1), the individual workpackages then focused on:

- (WP 2) describing research-relevant concepts (e.g. molecules, chemical reactions or journal articles) in terms of Wikidata's continuously evolving data model
- (WP 3) establishing exchange and curation workflows between Wikidata and external databases hosting information about these concepts (e.g. identifier mapping)
- (WP 4) using Wikidata content in research workflows (e.g. querying it, or using its identifiers in research notebooks), including citizen science projects;
- (WP 5) training, education and outreach around these topics, with a focus on creating openly licensed educational materials that could be reused in other contexts

The specific objectives of the project are: 

1. Goal 1:
1.1. to provide a VRE where contributions are transparent and trusted because all changes are accountable and a full history of changes is publicly available;
1.2. to enhance the verifiability of statements by accompanying them with provenance and references (Task 3.2);
1.3. to increase the scale and immediacy with which scientific information is made globally available to both people and machines, and curated by them;

2. Goal 2:
2.1. to support transdisciplinary science by promoting the adoption of a single open data VRE platform across disciplines from the natural sciences to the humanities;
2.2. to establish a single open-data VRE platform by piloting it for a set of core use cases (chemistry, library and information science, biodiversity science, mineralogy and the cultural heritage sector);
2.3. to promote the open-source Wikibase software (of which Wikidata is an installation) as a framework also installable and adaptable for institution-internal knowledge management

3. Goal 3:
3.1. to establish the use of stable identifiers for scientific objects and concepts (which are dereferenceable, i.e. can be actively followed to obtain further information) in a pilot of 5 large and 10 smaller scientific datasets (WP2 and Task 3.1);
3.2. to increase the interlinking of information by making a large number of scientific objects and concepts citable in a long-term stable and sustainable manner in the Linked Open Data Cloud

4. Goal 4:
4.1. to develop and provide documentation, training materials, tutorials, open educational course materials, best-practices advice, as well as dissemination and community engagement events (WP5);
4.2. to increase the number of citizen data scientists and citizen data curators interacting with professional scientific researchers and professional research organisations with the aim to increase the quality of the data available for all (Task 4.5);
4.3. to increase the number of external citizen science projects that use Wikidata (Task 4.5)


The Wiki4R VRE will be modular. The existing Wikidata infrastructure already fulfils several requirements of a modern VRE
Ultimately, the web itself – especially the Semantic Web combined with web-based computing services – is the full VRE

Managing openness is not a trivial exercise. It requires both appropriate technical foundations and procedural and social competencies, rules and policies.

Sharing the semantics of research data early in the research process has great potential in increasing the efficiency of research. Doing so enables the expression of knowledge by the authoritative researchers, rather than the kind of guesswork that typically has to occur when adding semantic tagging to research publications that are not inherently semantic (but, for example, have been published as PDF).

While the Semantic Web addresses many technical issues, it becomes truly effective only if data are semantically interlinked to provide context (the final star in Berners-Lee’s five star concept).

Open data can in general be an excellent basis for business. An apt example is the recent decision to dissolve the Google Freebase system in favour of the broader Wikidata integration possibilities, with Google reasoning: “they’re growing fast, have an active community, and are better-suited to lead an open collaborative knowledge base.“ We agree with Google’s assessment and consider it important to build capacities on exploiting openness such that the European economy may benefit.

WP 4: “Enabling the use of Wikidata in research contexts” will integrate Wikidata into the daily workflows of professional scientists to create a full VRE. 

Task 4.3 Wikidata identifiers in the lab (Lead UPS; all partners; Month 10-28)
This task will integrate the functionality of an existing laboratory database portal developed by UPS into Wiki4R to provide a test case for Wiki4R.

To illustrate how this might look like, consider the classical case of a curator on Galaxy Zoo being presented an image of a galaxy and tasked with the assessment of whether that galaxy is elliptical, spiral or neither. Depending on the assessment of that curator or of multiple curators on Galaxy Zoo, the corresponding Wikidata item for that galaxy could then be created or updated as to whether it is an instance of an elliptical or spiral galaxy.

The management of risks is detailed in Table 12.
