# Highlights

 Although mammalian genomes
contain millions of potential enhancers, only a small subset of them is active in a given cell
type. Cell type-specific enhancer selection involves the binding of lineage-determining
transcription factors that prime enhancers. Signal-dependent transcription factors bind to
primed enhancers, which enables these broadly expressed factors to regulate gene
expression in a cell type-specific manner.

 As the complement of active cis-regulatory
elements is different across cell types, these findings
introduced the notion that pre-existing sets of enhancers are primarily responsible for cell type-specific gene
expression and responses to external stimuli


s. Enhancers that
are known to be responsible for TAL1 transcription in endothelial cells (the –3.8‑kb and +19‑kb enhancers, relative to the
TAL1 promoter, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)) and in erythroid cells (the +51-kb enhancer in K562
cells) exhibit cell type-specific DNase I hypersensitivity, H3K4me2 and H3K27ac. In cell types in which TAL1 is not expressed,
the promoter and gene body are devoid of DNase HS regions and histone modifications that are indicative of enhancer
activation

Super-enhancers. On the basis of their epigenetic features and depending on the experimental methods used
to define enhancers, ~10,000–50,000 putative enhancers can be identified in a given cell type13,16,90, which
implies that there are more enhancers than expressed
genes

A substantial fraction of super-enhancers
and nearby genes are cell type-specific, and the gene sets
that are associated with super-enhancers in a given cell
type are highly enriched for the biological processes that
define the identities of the cell type
