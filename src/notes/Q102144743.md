# Highlights
. The Ontologies
Community of Practice (CoP) of the
CGIAR Platform for Big Data in
Agriculture harnesses the international
ontology expertise that can guide teams
managing multidisciplinary agricultural
information platforms to increase the
data interoperability and reusability.

The Community selects innovative solutions to assist the data
annotation with ontologies

The Ontologies Community of Practice of the CGIAR Platform for Big Data in Agriculture harnesses international expertise in knowledge representation and ontology development to produce missing ontologies, identifies best practices, and guides data labeling by teams managing multidisciplinary
information platforms to release the FAIR data underpinning the evidence of research impact.

--> too big of a phrase

Production: Data science output is validated, understood,
and regularly used for multiple domains/platforms

 IGAD’s Wheat Data Interoperability Working
Group published guidelines recommending a set of standards
and ontologies applicable to genetic, genomic, and phenotypic
data (http://datastandards.wheatis.org) for wheat


The CGIAR (https://www.cgiar.org/), the world’s largest global
agricultural innovation network dedicated to reducing poverty,
enhancing food security, and improving natural resources,
launched the Platform for Big Data in Agriculture (https://
bigdata.cgiar.org/) in 2017

In 2008, CGIAR initiated the development of the CO (http://
www.cropontology.org) in response to the need of breeding
data management systems and field books to have access to
valid lists of defined breeders’ traits and variables

Taking a step closer toward identifying and agreeing upon the
criteria that make an ontology a quality resource for data annotation, the Ontologies CoP organized a webinar with an Expert
Panel (https://www.youtube.com/c/OntologiesInAgriculture)
involving Christopher J. Mungall (Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory) and Pier Luigi Buttigieg (Alfred Wegener Institute),
who are both members of the OBO Foundry editor

A list of 17 key criteria, inspired by the OBO Foundry principles
(http://www.obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary.html),
was proposed by the Expert Panel (Table 1).
