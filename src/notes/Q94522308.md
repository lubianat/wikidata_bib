# Highlights

We describe a system that automatically generates from a curated database a collection of short conventional publications—citation summaries—that describe the contents of various components of the database

Moreover, these summaries also serve to give credit to publications and people that are cited by the database. In doing this, we need to deal with granularity—how many summaries should be generated to represent effectively the contributions to a database?

But does creating and publishing data citations guarantee that these people receive credit through current bibliometric measures, such as h-indexes, impact factors, etc.? The second, and apparently completely overlooked, issue is that many databases and data sets have ‘outgoing’ citations. If an article is cited by a well-known and widely used database, should not the article and its authors also receive credit through the established bibliometric measures?

We claim that data citation isn't working in the sense that the creation of data citations does not per se have any effect on the current bibliometric measures. That will only happen if there are documents—rather than databases—to which the citations refer.

First and foremost, the structure of the summaries should be such that they are recognized by citation analyzers. Google Scholar (3) makes it clear what is needed for a document to be recognized: a PDF file in a website that resembles a conventional paper, with a title, list of authors, contents and references
