# Highlights

This paper summarises the results from a consultation activity carried out in 2020 as part of the SYNTHESYS+ (Synthesys of Systematic Resources), “Developing implementation roadmaps for priority infrastructure areas as part of cooperative RI for biodiversity” project. This consultation was primed through an ideas paper, and introductory webinars and conducted as a facilitated two-week online multilingual discussion around 26 topics grouped under four broad headings (Users, Content, Technology and Governance). The results of these discussions are summarised here, along with the wider context of existing and planned initiatives.

Wikidata is already recognised as an identifier broker with potential to advance biodiversity knowledge graph development (Sachs et al. 2019) and is being used by successful community initiatives like Bionomia (Shorthouse 2020). It could be used to semantically link people, taxa, places, collections, institutions and more (Groom et al. 2020).

Furthermore, the collection objects themselves are not necessarily items of biological and geological diversity but may include associated materials such as field notebooks, photographs and ethnobotanical objects. Collections can be eclectic or have a specific focus and raison d'être, such as a xylarium.
