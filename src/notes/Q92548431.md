# Highlights

Using single-cell RNA sequencing of 166,242 cells
isolated from 21 individual organoids, we find that 95% of the organoids generate a virtually
indistinguishable compendium of cell types, through the same developmental trajectories, and with
organoid-to-organoid variability comparable to that of individual endogenous brains.


The data demonstrate that reproducible development of complex central nervous system
cellular diversity does not require the context of the embryo

 The six-month cultures contained substantial numbers of astrocytes,
confirmed by IHC for the astrocytic markers S100B and GFAP (Fig. 2c), as well as cycling
inhibitory interneuron precursors and immature inhibitory interneurons (Fig. 2aâ€“b).

To assess similarity between organoid cell types and those of the endogenous human brain,
we employed a published scRNA-seq dataset of human fetal cerebral cortex
