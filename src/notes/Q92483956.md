# Highlights

s. We find that dynamic membrane-like structures, consisting of a distinct population of CX3CR1+ tissue-resident macrophages, form an internal immunological barrier at the synovial lining and physically seclude the joint.

These barrier-forming macrophages display features that are otherwise typical of epithelial cells, and maintain their numbers through a pool of locally proliferating CX3CR1âˆ’ mononuclear cells that are embedded into the synovial tissue

In Cx3cr1GFP mice, we confirmed that such membrane-forming lining macrophages selectively expressed CX3CR1, stained positive for CD68 and F4/80, and constituted 40% of the total synovial macrophages under steady-state conditions. By contrast, interstitial synovial macrophages did not express CX3CR1 (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b).
