Identifiers.org - Compact Identifier Services in the Cloud
==========================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q100500142]  

# Highlights

Since its launch in 2010, Identifiers.org has become an important tool for the annotation and cross-referencing of Life Science data. In 2016, we established the Compact Identifier (CID) scheme (prefix:accession) to generate globally unique identifiers for data resources using their locally assigned accession identifier

We describe a set of services that can be used to construct and resolve CIDs in Life Sciences and beyond.

The Identifiers.org registry contains manually curated, high quality metadata for hundreds of data collections, mostly in the Life Science domain (Juty et al., 2013), with each assigned a unique namespace, which can be used as a prefix (Wimalaratne et al., 2018).
Automated checks are performed registry wide on all the listed resources, to determine their availability.

the use of CIDs has been recommended by Nature Scientific Data for data citations (editorial, 2018), and by Google Dataset Search for identifiers  https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset.

Identifiers.org collaborates with the US-based Name-to-Thing (N2T, https://n2t.net/) resolver to harmonize the resolution of CIDs.
programmatic access to these services is enabled by web frontends and a client library, cloud-libapi (https://github.com/identifiers-org/cloud-libapi)

We have developed a responsive web front end that encompasses three different domains: 
(1) Resolver (https://identifiers.org/), (2) Registry (https://registry.identifiers.org/), (3) Documentation pages (https://docs.identifiers.org/.

The Identifiers.org metadata service enables users to access schema.org (https://schema.org/) and bioschemas (https://bioschemas.org/) metadata.

The long-term commitment to maintaining an exhaustive and up to date list of active resolving locations is an expensive and often duplicated task; most publishers and data providers maintain such a registry to resolve to the most commonly referenced data resources to support internal linking, cross-referencing and resolution. Identifiers.org incorporates a centralized registry that actively curates such information, as well as providing prefixes for use within the Life Sciences community.
