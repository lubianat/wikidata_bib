# Highlights
Europe PMC
now provides user accounts to save search queries
and claim publications to ORCIDs, as well as open
access profiles for authors based on public ORCID
records. We continue to foster connections between
scientific data and literature in a number of ways.
All the data behind the paper - whether in structured archives, generic archives or as supplemental files - are now available via links to the BioStudies database. Text-mined biological concepts, including database accession numbers and data DOIs, are
highlighted in the text and linked to the appropriate data resources. The SciLite community annotation platform accepts text-mining results from various contributors and overlays them on research articles as licence allows. In addition, text miners and
developers can access all open content via APIs or
via the FTP site.

Europe PMC is an ELIXIR
Core Data Resource,

The External Links service (https://europepmc.org/LabsLink) provides additional literature–data connections. It enhances
existing content and helps users find relevant additional resources, such as alternative metrics, peer reviews, the full
text of publications in institutional repositories, Wikipedia
articles, or teaching materials


Author search. To help disambiguate academic authors,
Europe PMC has previously integrated ORCIDs (https:
//orcid.org), unique researcher identifiers. In addition to
ORCID-based author searching, Europe PMC now provides a ‘Suggested Authors’ feature


For many biological studies, it is common nowadays to
produce several types of data that may reside in different
databases, or as supplementary files appended to articles.
To address the challenge of linking all the data pertaining
to a study together, the EMBL-EBI has developed BioStudies (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/), a new database
that acts as a data container and holds descriptions of biological studies and links to data from these studies in other
databases, while archiving data that do not fit in the structured archives

--> Cool.

It is of critical importance that readers find the annotations useful. Readers can validate individual annotations,
providing feedback that can improve text-mining accuracy.
The feedback link appears on the popup window, allowing
users to endorse useful annotations, or report incorrect or
generic annotations

. The SciLite RDF endpoint is publicly
available (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/europepmc/rdf/sparql) and
contains over 1.4 billion triples (at the time of writing)
