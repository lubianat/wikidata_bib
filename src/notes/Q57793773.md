# Highlights

The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB, rcsb.org), the US data center for the global PDB archive, serves thousands of Data Depositors in the Americas and Oceania 

. Recent reorganization of RCSB PDB activities into four integrated, interdependent services is described in detail, together with tools and resources added over the past 2 years to RCSB PDB web portals in support of a ‘Structural View of Biology.’

Since 1999, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB, rcsb.org) (3,7,8) has been funded by the NSF, NIH and DOE to safeguard and nurture the PDB archive and provide open access to PDB data

For each PDB structure, RCSB PDB integrates related data each week from ∼40 external resources and offers sequence and 3D structure visualization tools for researchers, educators and students.

Together, RCSB PDB Archive Management/Access and Data Exploration Services provide a one-stop shop for >1 million rcsb.org users annually,

Bi-coastal deployment has allowed scaling of ftp, Rsync and RESTful web services to meet our Service Level Objective of >99% uptime 24 × 7 × 365
