# Highlights
this paper presents data visualization in the
form of various heatmaps resulting from machine learning experiments
using BERT embeddings, t-SNE, and K-means clustering that show the
kinds of topics, or domains, in Wikidata and the frequency of multilingual data across such domains

What is the distribution of multilingual data
across different languages and topics or domains in Wikidata, and how can such
distributions identify lack of coverage in multilingual data?

The March 1, 2021 Wikidata JSON dump (>80GB) was profiled using Python.

. As the distribution of sets has a long tail, a threshold of at least one thousand items
was used which resulted in a |S| of 1588 sets that account for 97.15% of all items.

Wikidata’s ontology does not explicitly assign classes
of entities into specific subject matter “domains” as was the case for Freebase
with such domains as “awards” and “zoos” [1]. For external validation of the
learned clusters, ground truth labels were created by iteratively generating category labels by the authors using a grounded theory approach to qualitatively
code each P31 object set based on its English labels, descriptions, aliases and
other relevant information.
