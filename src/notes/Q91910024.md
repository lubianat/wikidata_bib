# Highlights
Using a text-mined database, we applied a previously described network-based computational repositioning algorithm, yielding strong results via cross-validation, averaging 0.95 AUROC on test-set indications.

At various time points, we built networks corresponding to prior knowledge for use as a training set, and then predicted on a test set comprised of indications that were subsequently described. This framework showed a marked reduction in performance, peaking in performance metrics with the 1985 network at an AUROC of .797. 

However, as good as these algorithms have become at providing repurposing candidates from a list of known indications, the majority of computational repositioning projects do not continue beyond the in vitro studies [10].

In this work, we evaluated the utility of text-mined networks for use in computational compound repositioning, by utilizing the Semantic MEDLINE Database (SemMedDB) [14] as an NLP-derived knowledge network, and the Rephetio algorithm for producing predictions.

The PostgreSQL dump of DrugCentral dated 2018-06-21 was downloaded for use as the gold standard of known drug-disease indications.

Further enhancing our understanding of mechanistic relationships that these concepts will likely result in further increases to computational repositioning performance.
