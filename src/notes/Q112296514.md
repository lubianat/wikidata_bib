# Highlights
Vaccines stimulate various immune factors critical to protective immune responses. However, a comprehensive picture of vaccine-induced immune factors and pathways have not been systematically collected and analyzed. To address this issue, we developed VaximmutorDB, a web-based database system of vaccine immune factors (abbreviated as “vaximmutors”) manually curated from peer-reviewed articles. 

VaximmutorDB currently stores 1,740 vaccine immune factors from 13 host species (e.g., human, mouse, and pig). These vaximmutors were induced by 154 vaccines for 46 pathogens.
This article reports VaximmutorDB (http://www.violinet.org/vaximmutordb), a web-based database that focuses on the collection, storage, annotation, and analysis of vaccine-induced immune factors.
