# Highlights

o addressthe barriers in using TM in biocuration, BioCreative hasbeen conducting user requirements analysis and user-basedevaluations, and fostering standards development for TMtool  re-use  and  integration.

Similarly, three teamsthat participated in BioCreative IV, participated again inBioCreative V with their systems presenting enhancementsbased on feedback from previous participation.

Also, in parallel toIAT track, BioCreative V has introduced the CollaborativeBiocurator Assistant Task (BioC) (11), which explores theintegration of the BioC format (12) output from differentTM modules to provide a system for literature curation ofproteinâ€“protein   interactions   tailored   for   the   BioGridDatabase (13)
