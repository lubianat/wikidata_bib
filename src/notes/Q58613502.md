# Highlights
A common task is to accurately estimate the effect size, often in terms of a logarithmic fold change (LFC).

Here, we propose the use of a heavy-tailed Cauchy prior distribution for effect sizes, which avoids the use of filter thresholds or pseudocounts. The proposed method, Approximate Posterior Estimation for generalized linear model, apeglm, has lower bias than previously proposed shrinkage estimators, while still reducing variance for those genes with little information for statistical inference.

. The authors of edgeR (McCarthy et al., 2012) and limma-voom (Law et al., 2014) suggest using a filtering rule that removes genes with low scaled counts before statistical analysis (Chen et al., 2016). Other methods take a Bayesian modeling approach, including ShrinkBayes (van de Wiel et al., 2013) and DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014). DESeq2 applies an adaptive Normally distributed prior, to produce a shrinkage estimator for the LFC for each gene. However, in our analysis, we found that filtering or application of Normal priors each can have drawbacks, either leading to loss of genes with sufficient signal, or overly aggressive shrinkage of true, large LFCs.

We use various approximation techniques to provide Approximate Posterior Estimation for the GLM (apeglm).
