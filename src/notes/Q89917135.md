# Highlights

In summary, ncEP provides a relatively comprehensive repository of the
LTEV proteins or peptides encoded by ncRNAs and will enrich the knowledge for translation process. ncEP is
freely available at http://www.jianglab.cn/ncEP/.

Anderson et al. identified the MLN peptide as an
important regulator of skeletal muscle physiology [3].

Magny et al. identified two peptides with less than 30
amino acids encoded by lncRNAs SclA and SclB.
These peptides can regulate calcium transport in the
process of regular muscle contraction in the Droso-
phila heart [

  Studies have demon-
strated that several proteins encoded by circRNAs
were involved in tumor growth. FBXW7-185aa
encoded by circRNA circ-FBXW7 regulated the
stability of the c-Myc oncoprotein and inhibited
proliferation and cell cycle acceleration in glio-
blastoma cells [6].
