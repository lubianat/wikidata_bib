# Highlights

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a rare luminal population in the mouse prostate that expresses stemlike genes (Sca1+ and Psca+) and a large population of differentiated cells (Nkx3.1+, Pbsn+).

In organoids and in mice, both populations contribute equally to prostate regeneration, partly through androgen-driven expression of growth factors (Nrg2, Rspo3) by mesenchymal cells acting in a paracrine fashion on luminal cells.

To characterize the different cell populations of the prostate, we collected droplet-based scRNA-seq profiles from 13,398 cells from the mouse prostate (concentrating initially on the anterior lobe).

Validation of luminal subset markers in situ. Shown is immunofluorescence (IF) staining of L1 (CD26/Dpp4, cyan, top) and L2 (Tacstd2/Trop2, red, middle) markers in the proximal and distal anterior lobe, along with Epcam (for epithelial cells, white), Ck5 (basal cells, green), and DAPI (nuclei).

The larger luminal population shares features with L1 cells in the mouse, such as expression of secretory and AR-regulated genes (CD26/DPP4high, KLK3/PSAhigh, and PLA2G2A+). The smaller luminal population is more stem like (PSCA+ and KRT4+), reminiscent of L2 cells in the mouse, and is primarily distinguished by expression of the secretoglobulin family gene SCGB1A1+


o determine the effect of androgen withdrawal on RNA expression in the human prostate, we generated scRNA-seq profiles from the histologically normal regions of eight of these samples (four hormonally intact and four ADT treated) (
