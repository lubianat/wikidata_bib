# Highlights
Recently, the MetaSRA project standardized these metadata by annotating each sample with terms from biomedical ontologies. In this work, we present a pair of Jupyter notebook-based tools that utilize the MetaSRA for building structured datasets from the SRA in order to facilitate secondary analyses of the SRAâ€™s human RNA-seq data. 

These tools were the result of a three-day-long NCBI Codeathon in March 2019 held at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The MetaSRA also features an interface (http://metasra.biostat.wisc.edu) for querying human RNA-seq samples using these ontology term annotations.

To address these two tasks, we produced two Jupyter notebook-based tools. The first tool, called the Case-Control Finder, searches the SRA via the MetaSRA terms to produce matched-case and control samples for a given disease or condition where the cases and controls are matched by tissue and cell type. The second tool, called the Series Finder, finds ordered sets of samples for the purpose of answering biological questions pertaining to changes over a numerical property (e.g., time).
