# Highlights


With this in mind, we investigated Brazilian observations on iNaturalist to assess the feasibility of the data available on the platform as a basis for studies on the tropical terrestrial gastropod fauna. The observations on iNaturalist were filtered by country, Brazil, and higher taxa, namely Eupulmonata, Cyclophoroidea and Helicinoidea, yielding a sample of 4,983 observations. 

 Unsurprisingly, the knowledge of terrestrial gastropods in the Global South, where the vast majority of biodiversity is located [5], is lagging [6–8].

 Internal validation on iNaturalist requires that at least two users out of three endorse any given identification for an observation to achieve a so-called “research-grade”. This seemingly democratic system is hampered by a few problems, such as users validating misidentifications suggested by the platform’s AI (which typically suggests European or North American taxa, even for observations in Brazil or elsewhere). As the system ranks users based on the number of IDs, “clickers”, i.e., users who want to accumulate as many IDs as possible regardless of whether they are correct or not, make the problem even worse
