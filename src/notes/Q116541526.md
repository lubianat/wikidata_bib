# Highlights

A recent survey of experimental data, using mostly morphology as a proxy for cell type, revealed allometric scaling of cell type diversity with organism size

volving a new cell type has, 1. a fitness cost that increases with organism size, 2. a fitness benefit that also increases with organism size but 3. diminishes exponentially with the number of existing cell types. I will show that these assumptions result in a quantitative model that fits the observed cell type numbers across organisms of all size and explains why we should not expect isometric scaling.


For example, the Tabula Sapiens consortium recently identified over 400 cell types across 24 different human tissues (Tabula Sapiens Consortium et al., 2022).\

A simple model assuming diminishing fitness benefits of additional cell types performs as well as a double power law in explaining cell type allometry. Fisher et al. (2013, 2020)) c

Here, I will argue, from an evolutionary fitness perspective, that we should expect much fewer cell types than cells in an organism.

I therefore model the appearance of new cell types during evolution as discrete events that have an associated fitness cost Δfcost and benefit Δfbenefit, which must result in a net-positive fitness change Δf=Δfbenefit−Δfcost. A common mechanism for the evolution of new cell types is the functional segregation of a multifunctional ancestor cell type into multiple sister cell types (Arendt, 2008)
