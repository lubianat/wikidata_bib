# Highlights

Here, we analyzed gene expression in over 80,000 individual cells isolated from 31 human brain organoids. We find that organoids can generate a broad diversity of cells, which are related to endogenous classes, including cells from the cerebral cortex and the retina.

By seeding initial embryoid bodies (EBs) with a reduced number of pluripotent stem cells (2,500 cells), optimizing neural induction, and adding BDNF to the final differentiation medium, we obtained long-term, progressive development for over 9 months (mo) (Figure 1a, Extended Data Figure 1; see Methods). With this protocol, organoids do not become hypoxic, and levels of programmed cell death remain relatively low up to 9 mo (Extended Data Figure 1a). The yield of organoids from initial EBs was also improved, to >95% at 1 month with the iPSC11a line and 70% for HuES66

Six of the seven clusters belonged to the neurectodermal lineage; however, one cluster (c1; 3,027 cells) expressed mesodermal markers, including Myogenin and Myosin genes (MYH3, MYH8, MYL1, MYLPF), ind

 cluster c5 contained virtually all of the cell classes found in the mouse retina. Specifically, we identified populations corresponding to Muller glia cells (e.g., DKK3, SOX9), pigmented epithelial cells (e.g., MLANA, MITF), photoreceptors (e.g., CRX, RCVN, NRL), retinal ganglion cells (e.g., NEFL, NEFM), bipolar cells (e.g., LHX4, PCP2), and amacrine cells (e.g., TFAP2B, SLC32A1)

 he data indicate that brain organoids establish spontaneously-active neuronal networks and generate functional photo-sensitive cells, which may in the future permit modulation of network activity using physiological sensory mechanisms.
