# Highlights

We use ontology-based machine learning methods to evaluate the contribution of formal axioms and ontology meta-data to the prediction of protein–protein interactions and gene–disease associations. We find that the background knowledge provided by the Gene Ontology and other ontologies significantly improves the performance of ontology-based prediction models through provision of domain-specific background knowledge. 

Our findings motivate the need for further development, and the systematic, application-driven evaluation and improvement, of formal axioms in ontologies.

While axioms are mainly exploited through automated tools and methods, ontologies also contain labels, synonyms and definitions (Hoehndorf et al., 2015b); improving the human-accessible components of ontologies has also been a major focus of ontology development (Köhler et al., 2006); for example, including ‘good’ natural language definitions and adequate labels is a requirement for biomedical ontologies in the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry (Smith et al., 2007), an initiative to collaboratively develop a set of reference ontologies in the biomedical domains.

For example, the GO classes Histidine catabolic process to glutamate and formamide (GO: 0019556) and Formamide metabolic process (GO: 0043606) are not directly (or closely) related in the GO hierarchy but both are related to the ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) class Formamide (ChEBI: 16397) through axioms formulated in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) (Grau et al., 2008), a formal language based on Description Logics (Horrocks et al., 2006).

Our results show that the PPI prediction performance obtained from feature vectors generated using GO-Plus (and the rich set of axioms it contains) outperforms the predictions obtained from using GO axioms alone, in both the unsupervised model (Onto2Vec) and the supervised model (Onto2Vec-NN). 

Including the meta-data (labels, definitions, synonyms, etc.) of the PATO ontology in the embeddings consistently decreases predictive performance across all our applications.

Our results have implications on the further development of knowledge bases and ontologies in the life sciences, in particular as machine learning methods are more frequently applied across the life sciences. Our findings motivate the need for further development, and the systematic, application-driven evaluation and improvement, of formal axioms in biomedical ontologies.
