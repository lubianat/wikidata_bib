# Highlights


We distinguish assertional,
contingent (prototypical), and universal statement units as basic types of statement units and propose
representational schemes and formal semantics for them (including for absence statements,
negations, and cardinality restrictions) that do not involve blank nodes and that translate back to OWL.
Compound units, on the other hand, represent semantically meaningful collections of semantic units
and we distinguish various types of compound units, representing different levels of representational
granularity, different types of granularity trees, and different frames of reference. 

ns: Semantic units support making statements about statements, can be used for graphalignment, subgraph-matching, knowledge graph profiling, and for managing access restrictions to
sensitive data. 

Solutions to these problems will be driven by sharing data across
many stakeholders, needing an effort to help interlink data providers from a diverse range of different
areas, often requiring a truly interdisciplinary approach (6), in which data stewardship remains in the
hands of the domain experts or institutions, thus ensuring their technical autonomy (following Barend
Monsâ€™ data visiting as opposed to data sharing (7)). 

In this context, knowledge graphs can substantially contribute to the needed technical solutions,
providing a suitable framework for managing and representing FAIR data and metadata (17).
Knowledge graphs are becoming increasingly popular (18), especially after the 2012 announcement
of the Google Knowledge Graph (19) w

Challenge 2: Many software developers do not see the benefit of
graph query languages
Most knowledge graphs are either directed labeled graphs that are based on RDF/OWL and stored in
tuple stores, or they are labeled property graphs such as Neo4j. Directly interacting with these graphs,
i.e., conducting CRUD operations for creating (=writing), reading (= searching), updating, and deleting
statements in the knowledge graph, requires the use of a query language. For RDF/OWL, this is for
example SPARQL (https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/), and for Neo4j, it is Cypher
(https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/).

 In other words, is-about statement units relate resources from the semantic-units graph with
resources from the data graph of a knowledge graph and can be used as an index for where in the
graph a change of frame of reference occurs
