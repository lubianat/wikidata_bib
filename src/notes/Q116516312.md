PKM2 is necessary to sustain splenic and hepatic iNKT cell function

PKM2 expression in iNKT cells is necessary to mitigate acute liver injury

Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a distinct population of lymphocytes characterized by their reactivity to glycolipids presented by CD1d.


Although a recent study described the involvement of glycolysis with T cell receptor (TCR) recycling and IFN-γ production in splenic iNKT cells,15 the tissue-specific metabolic adaptations of iNKT cells during steady state and diseases have not been described. Here, we show that tissue-resident iNKT cells have specific transcriptional signatures and adapt their metabolism in a tissue-specific manner at steady state and upon diseases.


In contrast, AT-iNKT cells were not affected by PKM2 deletion (Figure S2I), indicating a divergent metabolic adaptation of AT-iNKT cells compared with splenic and hepatic iNKT cells.

Thus, PKM2 is necessary for hepatic iNKT function, indicating that modulation of the immunometabolic signature of hepatic iNKT cells is sufficient to alter the outcome of liver injury. Together, our data demonstrate that hepatic and splenic iNKT cells are dependent on PKM2-driven glycolytic metabolism to properly function and that chemical or genetic ablation of glycolysis impaired cytokine production and the overall protective effect of iNKT cells in an acute model of hepatic injury.

 In contrast, transfer of iNKTΔAMPK to obese Jα18−/− mice did not modulate the M1/M2 ratio or IL-1β and IL-12 production by ATMs but did increase the number of crown-like structures (CLSs) in the AT
