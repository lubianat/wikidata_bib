# Highlights

In two pathway curation jamborees, Plant Reactome curators tested strategies for introducing researchers to pathway curation tools, harnessing biologists’ expertise in curating plant pathways and developing a network of community biocurators. We summarize the strategy, workflow and outcomes of these exercises, and discuss the role of community biocuration in advancing databases and genomic resources.

--> I disagree with the bottleneck

In order to engage the community for biocuration of genes and pathways, we have organized two pathway curation jamborees in 2017 and 2018 at Oregon State University. The aim of these jamborees was to introduce plant researchers to biocuration strategies and tools, develop a network of biologists for community curation and harness their expertise for curation and peer review of Plant Reactome pathways.

We organized a pathway curation jamboree in connection with the 2018 International Conference on Biological Ontology (ICBO 2018).

 4-day (20-hour) curation workshop, where participants could participate at their own pace while attending other activities at the conference. We opted for a ‘knowledge-centric’ focus for this workshop (as opposed to ‘tool-centric’).

 Once the participants had gathered the required data and visualized the macromolecular interactions graphically, we began pathway curation using PathVisio (https://www.pathvisio.org), a free, simple open-source application developed by WikiPathways. We encourage researchers to take advantage of training material available at http://academy.wikipathways.org to generate pathway figures and share their knowledge with the community using the WikiPathways platform.

 The support and motivation to train and engage biology researchers in biocuration could also come from publishers, and/or from collaborative efforts of public databases, and societies. For example, Scientific Data, a research journal published by Nature Publishing Group, has taken an initiative to engage authors in metadata curation prior to publication and to provide specific templates for furnishing the required information (30).

  Such exercises could help young researchers to think more critically about their own project, train in using relevant tools and resources and engage with the broader scientific community.

Finally, we agree with the suggestions made earlier by Howe et al. (18) and reiterate that community curation will be sustainable when individuals are appropriately rewarded for their work.

Professional curators will remain as the backbone of quality biocuration by (i) recruiting, training and supporting the community; (ii) reviewing the work submitted by community curators; (iii) developing new protocols for curation, software development and testing and (iv) outreach.
