# Highlights
Over 900 olfactory receptor genes and pseudogenes (ORs) were identified, two-thirds of which were not annotated previously. The number of extrapolated ORs is in good agreement with previous theoretical predictions.

ORs constitute 17 gene families, 4 of which contain more than 100 members each. “Fish-like” Class I ORs, previously considered a relic in higher tetrapods, constitute as much as 10% of the human repertoire, all in one large cluster on chromosome 11.

ORs are disposed on all human chromosomes except 20 and Y, and nearly 80% are found in clusters of 6–138 genes. 

The results of the data mining and characterization of ORs can be accessed at the Human Olfactory Receptor Data Exploratorium Web site (http://bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/HORDE).

To date, >300 human OR genes and pseudogenes have been reported

This led to the identification of a total of 906 human potential coding regions of OR genes and pseudogenes (hereafter referred to globally as ORs). 

We have assigned approximate chromosomal megabase (Mb) coordinates to most OR-containing genomic clones by integrating information from the University of California at Santa Cruz's genome draft (http://genome.ucsc.edu) with mapping information from UDB, the Unified DataBase (Chalifa-Caspi et al. 1998) andhttp://bioinformatics.weizmann.ac.il/udb. This led to the assignment of chromosomal coordinates for 85% of the ORs (Fig. 1).

The chromosomal distribution of ORs is extremely biased, with six chromosomes (1, 6, 9, 11, 14, and 19) accounting for 73% of the repertoire. 

Of the 681 full-length ORs identified, 359 (53%) have one or more frame disruptions (frameshifts, in-frame stop codons, or disrupting interspersed repeats (Fig. 2b) and are considered to be pseudogenes. 

Class I ORs have originally been identified in fish (Ngai et al. 1993) and subsequently found to be intermixed with Class II (mammalian-type) ORs in amphibian species (Freitag et al. 1995).

we now observe >900 human ORs, of which ∼800 arise from studying large genomic sequences. This suggests that once the human genome is finished, the overall number may rise to 1000 or more, in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction (Lancet et al. 1993).

Class II families are all present in more than one chromosome each, except for the very small family 12.
