# Highlights

Current biomedical research needs to leverage and exploit the large amount of information reported
in scientific publications. Automated text mining approaches, in particular those aimed at finding relationships
between entities, are key for identification of actionable knowledge from free text repositories. We present the
BeFree system aimed at identifying relationships between biomedical entities with a special focus on genes and
their associated disease

only a small proportion of the
gene-disease associations discovered by using BeFree is collected in expert-curated databases. Thus, there is a pressing
need to find alternative strategies to manual curation, in order to review, prioritize and curate text-mining data and
incorporate it into domain-specific databases. We present our strategy for data prioritization and discuss its implications
for supporting biomedical research and applications

--> Yeah, more or less. Only if the databases themselves are really interoperable.

An important aspect in the field of relation extraction
(RE) are the different _perspectives_ that can be used to define the relationships between entities. The relationship
between two entities might be unqualified or not specified
at the semantic level (e.g. “The LOXL1 gene _is associated
with_ exfoliation glaucoma”), or, on the other hand, semantically specified (e.g. “The LOXL1 gene _is overexpressed in_
exfoliation glaucoma”). Moreover, the relationships can
also be considered from the perspective of their level of
certainty; that is, if the scientific statement is phrased as a
fact or proven experimental observation or, alternatively,
as a speculation or hypothesis (e.g. “The LOXL1 gene
_might be associated with_ exfoliation glaucoma”)

--> Good description


Finally, complex representations of relations are the events as defined
by the BioNLP shared tasks, that involve several participant entities, semantically-defined relationship types and
their regulators 


A pragmatic way to assess the quality of the extracted
information is to contrast it to the information present
in expert curated resources. Thus, we integrated the data
extracted by Befree with expert reviewed DisGeNET
sources 

 It is interesting to note that most of the disease
concepts present in the curated sources in DisGeNET
contain MeSH terms, while this is not the case for the
data extracted by BeFree

Biocuration of large data sets, a.k.a. big data, is becoming a bottleneck for biomedical research. Recently, the
crowdsourcing approach has attracted interest in the
bioinformatic domain and holds promise for biocuration
tasks [46]. As more and more scientific groups are
extracting knowledge blocked in free text by text mining
and exposing it to the public domain, another upcoming
question is the meta-curation of such deluge of data. In
this regard, the nanopublication concept, based on Semantic Web triple-assertions, is a promising approach to
aid the prioritization of associations based on the supporting evidence [47]. This kind of approaches could be
applied to large datasets such as the gene-disease associations extracted by BeFree
