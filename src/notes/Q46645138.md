# Highlights

Gore et al. describe the community-recommended validation reports,produced by wwPDB at deposition andbiocuration of PDB submissions, andintegrated into the archive of publiclyreleased PDB entries.

, Val50 in the struc-ture of the protein annexin (PDB: 2HYV;Shao et al., 2006)isinvolved in Ca2+ion coordination and is consistently flagged asa Ramachandran outlier. Such unusual features should, how-ever, be supported by convincing experimental evidence. ThewwPDB is working toward providing depositors with a mecha-nism for adding explanatory comments to the official wwPDBvalidation reports

 addition, unresolved issues may be uncovered bywwPDB biocurators or by manuscript reviewers, who are pro-vided with access to the official wwPDB validation report. Oneof the more time-consuming tasks faced at present by wwPDBbiocurators is the reprocessing of entries, as occasioned bydepositors submitting revised atomic models to address issuesuncovered during biocuration or manuscript peer review. ThewwPDB stand-alone validation server (https://validate.wwpdb.org) was developed with the express purpose of enabling depos-itors to identify problems and resolve them in advance ofsubmission.To incorporate state-of-the-art validation tools into thewwPDB biocuration pipeline
