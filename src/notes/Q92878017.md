# Highlights

An extracellular RNA atlas from five
human biofluids (serum, plasma,
cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, and urine)
reveals six extracellular RNA cargo types,

The analysis leads to a model with six exRNA cargo types
(CT1, CT2, CT3A, CT3B, CT3C, CT4), each detectable
in multiple biofluids (serum, plasma, CSF, saliva,
urine)

Additional separation experiments suggest association of the cargo types with specific
vesicular and non-vesicular (RNP and lipoprotein) exRNA car-
riers. We show that these findings and Atlas resources facilitate
interpretation of exRNA profiling studies by providing estimates
of cargo type proportions in each sample and by tracing exRNA
differences between cases and controls to specific cargo types
and their associated carriers.

we limited the exRNA Atlas bio-
sample profiles to seven major endogenous RNA biotypes:
miRNA, Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA), tRNA, Y RNA, lincRNA,
small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA).

Specifically,
we correlated the 75 exRNA cargo profiles (columns in Figure 4)
with RNA-seq profiles from (rows in the bottom half of Figure 4) 
<!-- various types of vesicles -->

Widely Used RNA Isolation Methods Show Cargo-
Type Bias

In summary, our results provide the first outline toward a map of
extracellular RNA communication in humans. We demonstrate
the power of sharing exRNA data and tools through the exRNA
Atlas resource to enhance interpretation of exRNA profiling data
from individual studies as well as across studies.
