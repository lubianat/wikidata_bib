# Highlights

. However, owing to the paucity of polymeric 
immunoglobulin receptors and plasma cells, how and whether 
antibodies are delivered to the type II mucosa represented by the 
lumen of the lower female reproductive tract remains unclear. 
Here, using genital herpes infection in mice, we show that primary 
infection does not establish plasma cells in the lamina propria of 
the female reproductive tract. Instead, upon secondary challenge 
with herpes simplex virus 2, circulating memory B cells that enter 
the female reproductive tract serve as the source of rapid and robust 
antibody secretion into the lumen of this tract.


Our current results reveal an inducible means of providing robust antibody secretion  
into the FRT. This understanding may be leveraged to create robust 
antibody-mediated vaccines against sexually transmitted infections.
