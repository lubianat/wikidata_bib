# Highlights

We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to profile genome-wide gene expression in about 9400 individual cerebellar cells from the mouse embryo at embryonic day 13.5.

Together, our data revealed cell-specific markers for studying the cerebellum, gene-expression cascades underlying cell fate specification, and a number of previously unknown subpopulations that may play an integral role in the formation and function of the cerebellum. 

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of the mouse cerebellum at embryonic day (E) 13.5

--> I like the use of "class"

One major challenge in scRNAseq is to discern whether a given cell cluster represents a stable cell type or a transient cell state. While we were preparing this manuscript, a study of scRNAseq of mouse cerebella at different embryonic stages was published (Carter et al., 2018). We integrated ours with the published datasets (E14.5, E15.5 and E16.5) to determine whether the cell groups identified at E13.5 persisted at the later stages.

emarkably, all cell groups identified in our E13.5 were detected at the later stages (Figure 8Câ€“D), indicating that many of the cell groups characterized above represent canonical cell types or subtypes

--> "canonical", strong ontological commitment
