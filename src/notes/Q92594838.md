# Highlights

 Herein, we discuss two approaches for synthesizing evidence for or against the use of specific PO interventions, namely, systematic reviews (SRs) and biocuration, and argue that their engagement with each other could facilitate the timely delivery of appropriate PO interventions.


Many conceptual frameworks have been proposed to facilitate clinical decision making by helping end users (especially patients and clinicians) assess the evidence for or against the use of medical tests, including biomarkers

 evidence-based medicine (EBM).17,18 EBM integrates a physicianâ€™s clinical experience with scientific evidence that has undergone an SR, which involves extensive surveying of the literature followed by a synthesis of the primary studies.19 The second is biocuration, which refers to the distillation and integration of biologic information from scientific literature and large data sets using database- or research field-specific, controlled vocabularies or ontologies; it is a cornerstone of bioinformatics.20 Both disciplines have the same overarching goal of bringing to patients only the interventions proven to be effective by carefully balancing benefits and harms, doing so in different ways; SRs start with a particular question and systematically develop the evidence base around it, whereas biocuration may be either top-down or bottom-up and usually involves more real-time updating.
