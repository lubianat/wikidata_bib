# Highlights
Midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons

As developing mDA neurons differentiate they diversify into
several mDA neuron subtypes with distinct innervation targets
and functions 4 . The subdivision into A8-A10 catecholamine
nuclei in the midbrain—substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc),
ventral tegmental area (VTA) and retrorubral ﬁeld (RRF)—was
initially based on anatomical parameters 4 . However, further
analysis of innervation targets, expression of speciﬁc genes, and
neurophysiology have elucidated additional diversity 5 .

nterestingly, two major branches of developing Pitx3-
expressing cells became evident with low levels of Dat to the left
side and high levels of Dat to the right side of the cellular network
(Fig. 2b). These two major branches are referred to as either
Dat low or Dat high .
