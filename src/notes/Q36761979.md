# Highlights
. Here, we report on an effort to bring together text mining tool developers and databasebiocurators to test the utility and usability of tools.

). To achieve this, expert biocura-tors may need to read and extract relevant informationfrom the biomedical literature. This literature curation pre-sents a considerable bottleneck in the biocuration processboth in terms of speed (efficiency) and cost (biocurator’stime); however, text mining tools have the potential tospeed up the curation process if they perform useful taskswith sufficient accuracy and speed (


The task by the curators included training, annotation andfilling of the user survey (Figure 1). For the training, eachbiocurator needed to perform a series of tasks thatincluded getting familiar with the system and curationguidelines provided by developers. At this stage, frequentcommunication between biocurators and developers wasencouraged, and various modalities were exploited.


n  BioCreative,  Textpresso  wasapplied for the curation of cellular localization in selecteddocuments forDictyostelium discoideumusing the GOcellular component ontology

n this ‘experiment’, we compared manual versus system-assisted curation to have a common baseline, but we areaware that this may not represent how a biocurator doesliterature curation in their curation workflow, and there-fore it may impact the efficiency of the manual task (time ittakes to complete the task). We think that this approach isstill very informative and along with the biocurators’ feed-back we should be able to better plan for BioCreative IV
