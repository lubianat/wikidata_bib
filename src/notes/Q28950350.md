# Highlights
The worldwide PDB (wwPDB) hasdeveloped a unified system, calledOneDep, for deposition, biocuration, andvalidation of macromolecular structuresto the PDB.

The PDB, which was established in 1971 with just seven X-raycrystal structures of proteins, became the first open-accessdigital primary data resource in biology (Protein Data Bank,1971). Today, the PDB archive serves as the single global re-pository for more than 120,000 experimentally determinedatomic-level structures of biological macromolecules (pro-tein, DNA, RNA) and their complexes

The OneDep system (http://deposit.wwpdb.org) provides acommon portal for deposition of atomic coordinates and associ-ated experimental data and metadata derived from the threecurrently supported methods of structure determination

For depositor convenience, OneDepdeposition pages can be pre-populatedwith metadata extracted directly froman uploaded PDBx/mmCIF file

Knowledge-Based Validation of Atomic CoordinatesAnalyses include criteria such as too-close contacts betweenatoms, Ramachandran (F,J) polypeptide chain backbonetorsion angle outlier statistics, rotameric states of proteinside chains, pucker states of RNA ribose rings, etc.,

The OneDep system uses a workflow management system todrive and monitor annotation, enabling consistent, efficient pro-cessing of multiple depositions in parallel. This workflow was de-signed to ensure completeness of annotation and to automateany necessary calculations, while providing interactive inter-faces wherein the wwPDB biocurator can inspect interim andfinal results.Biocuration of a new deposition involves a variety of tasks,each of which typically involves bulk calculations followed bymanual inspection/data input by an expert wwPDB biocurator(Figure 4).
