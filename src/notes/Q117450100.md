# Highlights
Herein, we introduce Bulk2Space (https://github.com/ZJUFanLab/bulk2space), a deep learning framework-based spatial deconvolution algorithm that can simultaneously disclose the spatial and cellular heterogeneity of bulk RNA-seq data using existing single-cell and spatial transcriptomics references.

We have not only reconstructed the hierarchical structure of the mouse isocortex but also further annotated cell types that were not identified by original methods in the mouse hypothalamus.

Several approaches such as CPM23, CIBERSORT24, and MuSiC25 can only extrapolate proportions of cell types from bulk RNA-seq data and have failed to further generate single-cell data, let alone map them to tissue coordinates

Next, the generated single cells were allocated to optimal spatial locations using a spatial transcriptome reference. For this step, we chose as a spatial reference one of the two most commonly used spatially resolved transcriptomics technologies
