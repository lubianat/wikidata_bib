# Highlights
Here we demonstrate that TH17 cells in a mouse model of autoimmune disease are functionally and metabolically heterogeneous; they contain a subset with stemness-associated features but lower anabolic metabolism, and a reciprocal subset with higher metabolic activity that supports transdifferentiation into TH1-like cells. These two TH17-cell subsets are defined by selective expression of the transcription factors TCF-1 and T-bet, and by discrete levels of CD27 expression

 The transcriptomes of CD27+ and CD27− TH17 cells also showed considerable similarity with those of memory-like CXCR5+ and CXCR5− subsets, respectively, of exhausted CD8+ T cell

Moreover, Raptor-deficient and CD27+ (versus CD27−) TH17 cells shared downregulated metabolic pathways, including Myc and mTORC1 signalling and nucleotide metabolism.

rom a therapeutic perspective, much as targeting cancer stem cells is an important goal for successful anticancer therapy, the identification of stem-like TH17 cells opens up new avenues for therapeutic intervention in chronic inflammatory conditions.
