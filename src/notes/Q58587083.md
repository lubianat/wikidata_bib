# Highlights

ZFIN expertly curates, organizes and provides a wide array of zebrafish genetic
and genomic data, including genes, alleles, transgenic lines, gene expression, gene function, mutant phenotypes, orthology, human disease models,
nomenclature and reagents

Finally, we discuss ZFIN
as a member of the Alliance of Genome Resources, a collaboration among six model organism databases and the Gene
Ontology consortium.

The first phase of the ZFIN Regions Project was completed
in 2017 to increase support for genomic regions. A subset of
genomic regions was selected from the Sequence Ontology
to be supported in ZFIN (http://www.sequenceontology.
org/) (6)

Support for non-coding RNA genes and their transcripts
in ZFIN has also been increased: non-coding RNA genes
are now classified into Sequence Ontology (SO) based subcategories, such as miRNA Gene, lincRNA Gene, and
tRNA Gene. Each non-coding RNA gene type has a
unique identifier prefix in ZFIN (Table 2).

These simple GO annotations are limited in expressivity, and the context of the activity/function/cellular localization is often lost. For example, her8a (ZDB-GENE030131-2376) was annotated to the term ‘negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II’ (GO:0000122)
(8); however, curators could not specify in the GO annotation which genes were regulated by her8a

To create more descriptive GO annotations, ‘annotation
extensions’ were introduced by the Gene Ontology Consortium, allowing the recording of the biological context
(e.g. molecular targets, locational context, biological process context) in which the gene product performs its function (11). Annotation extensions are created by associating
a basic GO annotation with a relation and an entity, which
is an identifier for a database object or an ontology term
(11).

--> Also cool mechanism. 

The Alliance of Genome Resources (https:
//alliancegenome.org) was founded by six model organism databases (MODs: ZFIN, Mouse Genome
Informatics Database (http://informatics.jax.org/), Rat
Genome Database (https://rgd.mcw.edu/), FlyBase (http:
//flybase.org/), WormBase (https://wormbase.org), Saccharomyces Genome Database (https://yeastgenome.org)) and
the Gene Ontology Consortium (http://geneontology.org).
--> Cool

# Comments

ZFIN is beautiful. Maybe it is a community that I can re-engage in the future...
