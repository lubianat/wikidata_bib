# Highlights

We describe the work of The Biomedical Data Translator Consortium to develop a platform that supports the translation of data into knowledge by applying inferential methods to a graph representation of biomedical entities and their relationships.


In addition, randomized controlled clinical trials, once the “gold standard” of clinical research and practice, are now widely recognized as limited due to their inherent inability to target investigational treatments and therapies to patients who are most likely to demonstrate maximum benefit (and minimum harm) based on individual biomolecular profiles.

Why is the time right to build a Translator system? First, we have access to vast amounts of valuable clinical and biomolecular data, yet managing the data, integrating the data, analyzing the data, and extracting value from the data have proven to be both challenging and expensive.
