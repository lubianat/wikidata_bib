# Highlights

cientific Data has released a series of templates designed to help authors further engage with, and enhance, our metadata creation process.

The most tangible output of the curation process is the machine-accessible metadata record that forms a part of each Data Descriptor (in ISA-Tab format1; http://isa-tools.org).

The metadata records also power ISA-explorer, an experimental data discovery tool that supplements the journal and provides a user friendly interface to view the full machine-accessible record (http://scientificdata.isa-explorer.org)2. The metadata records are shared under a CC0 waiver (https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0) and can also be downloaded directly from each Data Descriptor.

Our authors are a vital part of the curation process, and it is important that they should feel an ownership of the generated metadata records, since these records will form part of their final publication

The metadata files are published under the CC0 licence, allowing other users and resources to ingest and mine this information without restriction. Please note that the metadata records are a value-added product and are not considered part of the 'version of record' of published articles. Therefore the metadata files may be updated from time to time; for instance, to reflect changes in metadata formats or community ontologies.
