# Highlights

s. A
comprehensive and structured aggregation of all the relevant components is to-date not
possible using standard database technologies, nor is it obvious how to include beliefs,
such as models and hypotheses into such a bundle. When such information is required as
the basis for important decision-making (e.g., in drug discovery), scientists often resort to
using commercial presentation applications. This is sub-optimal for the effective use of
knowledge, and alternatives that support the inclusion of meaning are urgently needed.
This paper describes a prototype Semantic Web application, BioDash1
, which attempts to
aggregate heterogeneous yet related facts and statements (using an RDF model) into an
intuitive, visually descriptive and interactive display
