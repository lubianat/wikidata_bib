# Highlights

Development of the human intestine is not well understood. Here, we link single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to characterize intestinal morphogenesis through time. We identify 101 cell states including epithelial and mesenchymal progenitor populations and programs linked to key morphogenetic milestones.

 Next, we undertook mapping of transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks to highlight key regulatory networks for each cell type and recreate a cell fate â€œdecision tree

We generated scRNA-seq profiles from 77 intestinal samples that were collected from 17 individual embryos representing diverse developmental time points and tissue locations (Figures 1A and 1B ) (Fawkner-Corbett et al., 2020
). Our dataset ranged from 8 to 22 PCW, spanning time points prior to crypt formation up to development of adult-like villus/crypt morphology (Figure S1A)

Complimentary to ECs, a pericyte sub-type was defined by angiogenesis drivers (PRRX1, THBS4, and ANGPT2).
