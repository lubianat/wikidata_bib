# Highlights
The longstanding objective of GXD has been to capture and integrate different types of mouse developmental expression information, with a focus on endogenous gene expression in wild-type and mutant mice, and to make these data readily accessible to researchers via biologically- and biomedically-relevant searches. As an integral component of the larger Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) resource (1–3),

 GXD curators annotate these data in standardized ways by making extensive use of controlled vocabularies and ontologies (7–10).

 We plan to expand the accessibility and benefit of cell type information in GXD by including annotations to the Cell Ontology (19) in our expression records. Such information is currently recorded in notes fields (as indicated in Figure 4C). The combined use of terms from the anatomy ontology and the cell ontology will refine our standardized representation of expression patterns and add new search capabilities.
