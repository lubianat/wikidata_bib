# Highlights

However, we found that the per-formance of existing feature selection methods was inconsistentacross benchmark datasets, and occasionally even worse thanwithout feature selection. Moreover, existing methods ignoredinformation contained in gene-gene correlations. We thereforedeveloped DUBStepR (Determining the Underlying Basis usingStepwise Regression), a feature selection algorithm that lever-ages gene-gene correlations with a novel measure of inhomo-geneity in feature space, termed the Density Index (DI)

A key feature ofDUBStepR is the use of a step-wise approach to identify aninitial core set of genes that most strongly represent coherentexpression variation in the dataset. Uniquely, DUBStepR de-fines a novel graph-based measure of cell aggregation in thefeature space, and uses this measure to optimize the numberof features.


Due to the strong association betweencorrelation range and marker gene status, DUBStepR selectsgenes with high correlation range score as the initial set ofcandidate feature genes (Methods).

The above benchmarking analy-sis was largely based on detection of relatively common celltypes (>10%of all cells).  To examine the performance offeature selection methods in detecting a rare cell type, we an-alyzed a published scRNA-seq dataset generated from humandendritic  cells  (DC)  and  monocytes  purified  from  PBMCs
