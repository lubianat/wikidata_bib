# Highlights

 Wagner et al. sequenced the transcriptomes of more than 90,000 cells throughout zebrafish development to reveal how cells differentiate during axis patterning, germ layer formation, and early organogenesis. Farrell et al. profiled the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of embryonic cells and applied a computational approach to construct a branching tree describing the transcriptional trajectories that lead to 25 distinct zebrafish cell types. 

 This approach first constructs a single-cell k-nearest neighbor graph for each time point t i , with nodes representing cells and edges that link neighbors in a low-dimensional subspace;
