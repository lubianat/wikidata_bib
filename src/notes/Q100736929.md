# Highlights


Furthermore, we identify a fetal gonadotrope cell subtype expressing the primate-specific hormone chorionic gonadotropin

1. The five hormone producing cell types develop in a stereotypical order from Rathkeâ€™s pouch, an epithelial invagination of the oral ectoderm. Previous studies have identified various

Co-immunofluorescence staining for SOX2 and Collagen III (COL3) suggested that mesenchymal cells encompass stem cells in human fetal pituitaries (Supplementary Fig. 3c).


The marker of the folliculostellate cells (FSCs) S100B was expressed in a small fraction (3.4%) of the stem cells of both the early and late stages (Fig. 1c). Comparison between the S100B-postive and S100B-negative stem cells revealed no DEGs relating to FSCs.
