# Highlights
To quantify biases in an unstructured citizen science platform, we contrasted bird observations from the unstructured iNaturalist platform with that from a semi-structured citizen science platform—eBird—for the continental United States. We tested whether four traits of species (body size, commonness, flock size, and color) predicted if a species was under- or over-represented in the unstructured dataset compared with the semi-structured dataset.

 Importantly, in programs like iNaturalist the detectability process is two-fold—first, an individual organism needs to be detected, and second, it needs to be photographed, which is likely easier for many large-bodied species. 

 In addition to being an excellent resource for scientists to better understand ecological questions, citizen science projects can encourage increased engagement of the general public with science37,38.

 At the state level, the number of eBird checklists and the number of iNaturalist observations were strongly correlated (Fig. 2a; R2 = 0.58, p-value < 0.001).
