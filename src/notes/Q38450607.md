# Highlights

MTB is accessed via the Mouse Genome Informatics web site (Author Webpage). Integrated searches of MTB are enabled through use of multiple controlled vocabularies and by adherence to standardized nomenclature, when available

The Tumor Frequency Grid has been revised to enhance interactivity, providing an overview of reported tumor incidence across mouse strains and an entr√©e into the database. A new pathology data submission tool allows users to submit, edit and release data to the MTB system.

The Tumor Frequency Grid graphically displays published tumor frequency data for inbred strains of mice in a grid format as a function of the strain and organ of tumor origin


Further planned development of MTB will expand data coverage to include measures of genomic/gene expression changes in tumors using techniques such as Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), spectral karotyping (SKY), gene expression arrays and cancer quantitative trait loci (QTL) data
