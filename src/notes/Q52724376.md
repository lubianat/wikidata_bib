# Highlights

If  the  connective tissue is  lost  or  its  density  is  altered,  the  behavior  ofthe deep  fascia  and underlying  muscle  becomes compromised. This could bethe source of myofascial painin many cases. One key elementaffecting fasciadensity seems to be HA
plasma  membranesof  most  cell  types  by  membrane-bound  synthases

roblast-like  cells  on  the  inferior  surface  of  the  deep  fascia that stained prominently with Alcian Blue. We suggested that these cells wererelated to other fibroblast-like cells in the vertebrate body but were specialized forHA synthesis and secretion (Stecco et al., 2011), similar to  the  synoviocytes  on  the  inner  surfacesof  joint  capsules  (Chang  et  al.,  2010)  that  synthesize  the  HA-rich synovial fluid, and the hyalocytes in the eye that elaborate theHA-rich humors of the anterior and posterior chambers (Sakamoto and Ishibashi, 2011). We suggested that they representa previously-unidentified class AcceptedArticle
of  cellsthat  we  called  “fasciacytes”. Fasciacytes have  not  yet been  analyzed morphologicallyand immunohistochemically;  thisisthe  purpose  of  the  current  study. 

Hematoxylin  and  eosin  (H&E),  and 0.05% Alcian Blue pH  5.8, which stains  acidic polysaccharides   such   as   glycosaminoglycans   (GAGs).

the cells described seemto have specific morphologyand location and a well defined function (Table 3). For these reasons we propose to call them ‘fasciacytes’as new class of fascia-associatedcells
