# Highlights
GeneSigDB (http://www.genesigdb.org or http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/genesigdb/) is a database of gene signatures that have been extracted and manually curated from the published literature. It provides a standardized resource of published prognostic, diagnostic and other gene signatures of cancer and related disease to the community so they can compare the predictive power of gene signatures or use these in gene set enrichment analysis.

Functional and pathway databases such as Gene Ontology (GO), KEGG and Reactome capture published descriptions of cellular pathways and gene functions (12), including, in the case of GO, functional predictions inferred from orthologous sequences (13). However, these resources are incomplete as we have not yet been able to comprehensively and completely catalog the functions of all genes in the genome (13).

In August 2009, we created GeneSigDB (17) as a repository for gene sets that had been systematically collected and manually curated from published articles indexed by PubMed.  

 In addition, we have improved the visibility of unmapped genes so that users can identify unmapped genes in a GeneSigDB standardized table
