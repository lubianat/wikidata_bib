# Highlights
KGCOVID-19 is a framework for producing
knowledge graphs that can be
customized for downstream applications
including machine learning tasks,
hypothesis-based querying, and
browsable user interface to enable
researchers to explore COVID-19 data
and discover relationships.


There have been a few parallel efforts to construct KGs to integrate
COVID-19 data, each integrating different data sources and constructed for different purposes. Several efforts have constructed
KGs by ingesting and transforming scientific literature10 (https://
lg-covid-19-hotp.cs.duke.edu/), some with a few additional types
of data also included, such as confirmed case and mortality data
(https://github.com/covidgraph/); clinical information, drug trial,
and sequencing data (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/
Wikidata:WikiProject_COVID-19);

 The merging of two or more graphs is performed by the KGX tool where nodes that have identical CURIEs and edges that have the same source node, edge type,
and target node are merged together. 

We use a core set of standardized ontologies and the Biolink
Model (https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model), a biological data
model for categorizing nodes and edges, to facilitate interoperability and data summarization. T

Knowledge Graph Node Embeddings Using
t-SNE
Embeddings were created for each node in the KGCOVID-19 knowledge graph and t-SNE was performed as described in Experimental Procedures.
Nodes categorized with one of the ten most
numerous Biolink categories were then selected.
Colors indicate the Biolink category for each node.
