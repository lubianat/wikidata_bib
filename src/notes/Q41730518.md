# Highlights
Here we set out tocharacterize transcriptional heterogeneity in mouse PSCs by single-cell expression profiling under different chemicaland genetic perturbations.

Notably, eitherremoval of mature microRNAs or pharmacological blockage of signalling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise groundstate characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency network, enhanced self-renewal and a distinct chromatin state, aneffect mediated by opposing microRNA families acting on theMyc/Lin28/let-7 axis. These data provide insight into thenature of transcriptional heterogeneity in PSCs.

Some transcriptswere detected in the vastmajorityof cellsexaminedand showed a log-normal distribution of transcript abundance withinthe population, as for the core pluripotency regulatorOct4(also calledPou5f1) (Fig. 1a)

As a population, 2i1LIFmESCs showed reduced heterogeneity as compared to serum1LIF mESCs,in keeping with the notion that inhibiting Erk and GSK3 signalling drivesmouse PSCs into a low-noise ground state

Pure systems biology, in the dynamical sense. Not so related with my research.
