# Highlights
We identify numerous classes of neurons, progenitors, and glia,
their proliferative, migratory, and activation states, and their relatedness within and across
age. Using the cell-type-speciﬁc expression patterns of genes mutated in neurological and
psychiatric diseases, we identify putative disease subtypes that associate with clinical phe-
notypes.

During this time, GABAergic interneurons differentiate from
progenitor cells in the VZs of subpallial ganglionic eminences and
migrate tangentially into the cortex

Cell types were grouped into categories (colored), based on their functional identity

--> Mixes clusters and cell types

Sub-clustering reveals closely related cell types and states. To
explore the identiﬁed cell types further and assess whether any
clusters harbored underlying cell sub-types or states, we devel-
oped an analytical methodology that focuses on heterogeneously
expressed genes within each cluster.

These genes were also highly expressed in RG of the
cortical hem (RG3, Cluster 21-E, Supplementary Figure 4), where
some Cajal-Retzius cells are known to originate 4

Cellular categorization is often hierarchical
in nature, such as in the fully developed adult brain 22,35 . How-
ever, cellular differentiation occurs along a continuum rather than
in discrete steps, causing cell nomenclature to blur, as we found in
transitioning and immature cell types.

We assembled a catalog of cell types in the developing mouse
cerebral cortex, described the spatial and temporal expression
patterns of hallmark genes, and uncovered underlying cellular
states and sub-clusters using a novel iterative analytical frame-
work.
