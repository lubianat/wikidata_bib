# Highlights

als. In mice, some 
glucagon-producing pancreatic α-cells and somatostatin-producing δ-cells become insulin-expressing cells after the 
ablation of insulin-secreting β-cells, thus promoting diabetes recovery.


Pdx1, Mafa and Nkx6-1 are β-cell-enriched transcription factors that 
are spontaneously upregulated in insulin-producing α-cells after total 
β-cell ablation in mice6

Global proteomic analyses confirmed that many of the upregu-
lated β-cell-related genes were also upregulated as proteins.

To dissect the reprogramming process at single-cell resolution, we 
performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq; Extended Data 
Fig. 9a). We analysed αGFP, βGFP and αPM pseudoislets cultured for 
1 week. Three distinct αGFP, αPM and βGFP cell populations were dis-
covered using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) 
visualization (Fig. 4a). Most cells in the αPM cluster were INS and GCG 
bihormonal, with little heterogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 9b).
