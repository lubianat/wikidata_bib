# Highlights

Exciting developments in single-cell-based RNA, protein, and chromatin profiling technologies offer new opportunities to characterize MC heterogeneity and to uncover novel MC functions and subtypes; these developments might lead to new and clinically effective therapies for certain pathologies. In this review, we provide an overview of the current understanding of MC development and heterogeneity and discuss new insights gained from single-cell-based studies that may lead to future research directions and therapeutic opportunities.

 MC activation is
thought to underlie numerous human diseases including common allergies within the skin, lung,
and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU; see Glossary), allergic
asthma, and food allergies;

Recent findings indicate that MCs have a dual developmental origin;
namely, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow (BM) and yolk sac in both mice
and humans [2,3,13].

--> Always interesting! Breaks the lineage-as-type assumptions

MCs are thought of as proinflammatory;
however, mouse skin-resident MCs can also secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 to limit
leukocyte infiltration, inflammation, and tissue damage associated with contact dermatitis and
chronic UV irradiation [22].

Both studies also suggested that MCs
are likely a major source of prostaglandin D2; such studies are also shedding light on the diversity
of MC phenotypes within tissues

Using the same publicly available scRNA-seq datasets
from mouse HSPCs [32] and unfractionated mouse BM cells [33], an independent study
identified E-cadherin expression (Cdh1 gene) in MC and basophil progenitors (Figure 2)
[34]

In this study, choroidal MCs were also identified, and genetic impairment of Hedgehog
signaling in vivo induced significant loss of choroidal MCs

A missense variant (C492Y) in ADGRE2 was found in a cohort of vibratory urticaria patients, and was thought to sensitize MCs to IgE-independent vibration-induced degranulation, as evidenced by localized hives and systemic manifestations in response to dermal vibration [62].

Sexual dimorphism is an important factor regulating the functions of cells. However, its role in MC function is only recently being
recognized. Bone marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) from female mice show an elevated release of granule components such
as β-hexosaminidase, histamine, tryptase, and TNF upon activation, compared to male mice [65]. T
