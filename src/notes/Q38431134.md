# Highlights

Bridgin levels of scale and ontex are key problens for
int n Bio- and Health Ih s F Arma ogic-based
ontologies using expessive foi are nauraly
'1fna"and provide new methods to support these aims.
The basic notion ofcomposition can be used to bridge scales;
aximns can be used to cany implicit specific
contex markers can be included in defnifrions and a
hierarchy of mantic links can be used to repeset subtle
in point of view. E rence with OpeGALE
the UK Drug Ontology and new e ents with the Gene
Ontology and Foundational Model of Anatomy suggest that
these amxpowerf tools provideprctal sohtion

A major advantage of fonnal ontologies for such tasks is hat
thy are natrally '"factal" - tW allow paten to be
repeat at p ely f levels of detail and smaller
scale Unlie nmy database techniques, decisions
concirg specific levels of detail or stucure need not be
fixed Strucftscanbeelbabat andevolveasrequhL



Bridging scales is aided by n of reing
princples in rbetween and witin scales A
useful way t cagi pi is to two
dimansions:
* Fnstal vs scal-ecific prncls- i.e. wher or not
he samne patennrpeatsat multiple scal
* Within scale vs bgIng scale priciples - e.g. whethr
th primiple applies widin any one scale or liks two or
murescale

Scales ar not abslute. hyare, at least in pa a matter of
our concealisations.

espite these sevaios, cmnnt exiience is sufficient to
indicate the usefulness and wide aplicability of the
tehiques. The fiidanxtally fiwal r re of fomal
ontoDogies, their ability to cm-bine indeicdet
suontologies, and their ability to manage subtle differenoes
in the meaning of semtic links makes them in attools
for the bridging of scales and contexts typical of

digitalization was bad, which makes highlighting quite funny
