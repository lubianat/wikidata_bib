# Highlights
Interoception, the ability to timely and precisely sense changes inside the body, is
critical for survival 1–4 . Vagal sensory neurons (VSNs) form an important body-to-brain
connection, navigating visceral organs along the rostral–caudal axis of the body and
crossing the surface–lumen axis of organs into appropriate tissue layers
Here we show that VSNs code visceral organ,
tissue layer and stimulus modality—three key features of an interoceptive signal—in
different dimensions. Large-scale single-cell profiling of VSNs from seven major
organs in mice using multiplexed projection barcodes reveals a ‘visceral organ’
dimension composed of differentially expressed gene modules that code organs
along the body’s rostral–caudal axis.


Whether a viscerotopic map exists in
the nodose ganglion, where most visceral-organ-innervating VSNs are
located 6 , is a subject of debate

rojection-seq analysis reveals a genetic segregation of VSNs that
innervate organs in the respiratory (lung), cardiovascular (heart), gas-
trointestinal (oesophagus, stomach, duodenum and transverse colon)
and exocrine–endocrine (pancreas) systems (
