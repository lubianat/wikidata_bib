# Highlights

. By adding
meaning to text, these techniques produce a more structured analysis of textual knowledge than simple word
searches, and can provide powerful tools for the production and analysis of systems biology models

Hypothesis generation using TM
Systems biology is one of the key examples of a field where
the mode of scientific knowledge discovery is shifting from
a hypothesis-driven mindset to an integrated holistic
mode that combines hypotheses with data [14,15]

In the data-rich
but hypothesis-poor sciences [16], including functional
genomics and most of biomedicine, the normative hypothesis-driven, deductive scientific method becomes increasingly difficult to sustain because it is unable to deliver
advances in knowledge quickly enough [17].

Swanson
pioneered the research of knowledge discovery from texts
[20] by exploring the benefits of inferring associations in a
series of experiments using simple semi-automated
methods to aid human discovery (Arrowsmith; http://
arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu/arrowsmith_uic/index.html).

When the aim is to identify and tabulate the facts reported
in large numbers of documents in a literature source,
information extraction (IE).

Data mining (DM) is used to discover unsuspected associations between known facts extracted by IE –

Most data mining techniques applied to biology
assume highly structured biological data, unlike the
unstructured textual data used by TM techniques.

Named entity recognition (NER) is the first step of IE.
NER relies on automatic term recognition (ATR), which
extracts terms from a collection of documents (whereas
ATR detects terms as opposed to general language words).
It assigns to terms such as ‘monocyte’ an appropriate label,
for example, CELL_TYPE, and the recognized terms are than
classified into broader domain classes (e.g. genes, proteins
or tissues). An example of such a system is TerMine (http://
www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/termine/), which is currently
developed by the National Centre for Text Mining (http://
nactem.ac.uk/).

--> Dealt with as if it is unambiguous, so interesting.

The knowledge extracted from text using
advanced TM can then be curated and used to update the content of biomedical ontologies, which currently lag behind in their attempts to keep abreast of new knowledge
because of its rapid expansion. Scientific databases, systems biology models and textual information are associated with each other through ontologies.


n. MEDIE enables the user to perform semantic querying, thus
going beyond keyword searching (Figure 6). These systems rely on a combination of deep linguistic knowledge,
the richness of annotations obtained from biological
resources (ontologies) and efficient parsing technologies
to produce biological interactions and relations extracted
from text, thus enabling the biologist to make generalisations and generate hypotheses.

The structure, equations and parameters, including starting or fixed concentrations, define the ODE system and can be
stored in a transmissible form as SBML [86] (systems
biology markup language; http://www.sbml.org)
