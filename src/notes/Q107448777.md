# Highlights
This review article focuses on the role of PCa cellular heterogeneity in therapy resistance and disease progression. Although AR-positive luminal-type cells represent the vast majority of PCa cells, there exists a minor component of AR-negative neuroendocrine (NE) cells that are resistant to hormonal therapy and are enriched by the treatment. In addition, it is now well accepted that a significant subset of hormonally treated tumors recur as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC), 

NE cells are present in benign prostate and throughout the entire spectrum of PCa

 Because of their rarity in benign prostate and most prostate tumors, they cannot be appreciated on standard H&E stained sections. However, through the use of electron microscopy, they can be identified and differentiated from luminal and basal cells by their elongated cell bodies and intracytoplasmic dense core secretory granules.
