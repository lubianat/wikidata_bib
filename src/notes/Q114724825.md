# Highlights

In the present study, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing, epigenomic SNP-to-gene maps and genome-wide association study summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted notable cell–disease relationships, including γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurons in major depressive disorder, a disease-dependent M-cell program in ulcerative colitis and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis.

F. f, Enrichments of brain cellular process programs for brain-related diseases and traits. Each of the cellular process programs is constructed using NMF to decompose the cells using a genes matrix into two matrices, cells by programs and programs by genes (NP = neural progenitor, CT = corticothalamic). Magnitude (E-score, dot size) and significance (−log10(P), dot color) of the heritability enrichment of cellular process programs (columns) are shown for brain-related diseases and traits (rows)
