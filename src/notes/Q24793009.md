# Highlights

The categories are classes of biological concepts (e.g., gene, allele, cell orcell group, phenotype, etc.) and classes that relate two objects (e.g., association, regulation, etc.) or describe one (e.g.,biological process, etc.)

Textpresso currently focuses onCaenorhabditis elegansliterature, with 3,800 full text articles and16,000 abstracts. The lexicon of the ontology contains 14,500 entries, each of which includes all versions of a specificword or phrase, and it includes all categories of the Gene Ontology database. Textpresso is a useful curation tool, aswell as search engine for researchers, and can readily be extended to other organism-specific corpora of text.Textpresso can be accessed at http://www.textpresso.org or via WormBase at http://www.wormbase.org.

We have developed a text processing system, Textpresso,that splits papers into sentences, and sentences into words orphrases. Each word or phrase is then labeled using theeXtensibleMarkupLanguage (XML) according to the lexiconof our ontology (described below).

The computer identifies terms by matching them againstregular expressions (such as the one shown above) andencloses them with XML tags. The tag,text.serves as acontainment of terms not semantically marked up. 


he power of Textpressoâ€™s search engine unfolds whencategory searches are used. By searching for a category, theresearcher is targeting all keywords that populate thatcategory

We have developed a system to retrieve information fromthe full text of biological papers and applied it to theC.elegansliterature. As of March 2004, the database contains fulltexts of 60% of all papers listed by theCaenorhabditisGeneticsCenter (CGC; http://www.cbs.umn.edu/CGC/CGChomepage.htm) and almost all abstracts that are information rich forC. elegansresearch.
