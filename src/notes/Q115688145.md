==========
  
  [@wikidata:Q115688145]  
  

# Highlights

Any immunotherapy was associated with clinical improvement in the patients with low risk for poor 2-year outcomes (RAPID scores 0–1), and the combination immunotherapy of steroid, immunoglobulin, rituximab and tocilizumab was associated with better outcomes in the patients with high risk for poor 2-year outcomes (RAPID scores 2–5). In patients with persistent disease at 6 months, continuing immunotherapy was associated with more improvement, while the effect of continuing immunotherapy for more than 12 months was unclear.
