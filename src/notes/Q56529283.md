# Highlights


Pdgfra-expressing (Pdgfra+) cells have been implicated as progenitors in many mesenchymal tissues.

 Pdgfra is expressed in selected cell types in a wide array of mesenchymal tissues, including the lung, heart, intestine, skin and cranial facial mesenchyme

 n the adult lungs, Pdgfra+ cells have been described to be in close proximity to alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s)

Genetic ablation of PdgfrÎ±+ cells led to simplified alveoli.

 These results suggest that Pdgfra-lineaged cells increase in number and upregulate SM22a expression following bleomycin-induced injury, and contribute significantly to pathological myofibroblasts in this model of adult pulmonary fibrosis.
