# Highlights

Specifically, we focus on extract-ing and understanding the contextual information (or context patterns) that is used by PubMedusers to represent semantic relations between entities such as ‘CHEMICAL-1 compared toCHEMICAL-2.’ With the advances in automatic named entity recognition, we first tag entities inPubMed queries and then use tagged entities as knowledge to recognize pattern semantics.

 However, documents with different words butsimilar semantics may be overlooked. Take the search en-gine  in  biomedical  domain,  PubMed  (1),  for  example.Semantically similar as the querieschlorthalidone vs hydro-chlorothiazideandchlorthalidone  versus  hydrochlorothia-zideare, PubMed returns 2.5 times more relevant articleswhen users compare these two drugs usingversusthan usingvs.
