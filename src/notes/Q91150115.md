# Highlights
We present a text-mining tool for recognizing biomedical entities in scientific literature. OGER++ is a hybrid system for named entity recognition and concept recognition (linking), which combines a dictionary-based annotator with a corpus-based disambiguation component.

The task of detecting spans of text that denote an entity of interest is usually referred to as named entity recognition (NER). It is commonly modeled as a tagging problem, where the text is a sequence of tokens that are classified as relevant or irrelevant and if multiple entity types are targeted assigned a type. In the closely related task of concept recognition (CR, often also referred to as entity linking, normalisation, or grounding), entities are additionally annotated with unique identifiers.
