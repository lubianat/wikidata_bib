# Highlights

In this work, we shift the focus on
the insights and the knowledge obtained by the machine learning models themselves. In particular,
we study how it can be extracted and used to inspire human scientists to increase their intuitions
and understanding of natural systems

We apply gradient boosting in decision trees to extract
human interpretable insights from big data sets from chemistry and physics.

While ML
models are successfully used and optimized to accelerate numerical predictions or to recognize or generate
patterns in existing data, it is rarely inquired how the
machine finds solutions, i.e. which patterns and correlations it detected and exploited. Thus, the scientific
insight obtained by the model is not directly transferred
to human scientists. 

In this work, we propose to use machine learning and
systematic data analysis to automate further the process of generation of interpretable scientific hypotheses.

--> It then gets very specific to physics/chemistry

We presented a data-driven machine learning workflow
for automated generation and verification of hypotheses
about observations in natural sciences. We presented
examples from chemistry and physics, but our method is
directly applicable to most applications, where structures
can be represented as graphs, e.g. to DNA/RNA data
in biology [50, 51], chemical reaction networks [52, 53]
or graphs in social sciences.
