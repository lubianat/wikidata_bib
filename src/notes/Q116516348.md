# Highlights

Such issues cut across different scientific disciplines that make them of interest to a variety of funders and institutions but may present challenges in understanding generalized needs. Here we present 10 simple rules for investing in scientific OSS and the teams who build and maintain it.

We address specific issues related to software, including contributor community development, governance, sustainability, and diversity and inclusion.

For the purposes of this paper, we will focus on the particular subset of OSS intentionally developed for research and will refer to this scientifically oriented software as either OSS or simply software.


As presented in the narrative below, the rules are primarily organized to suit the mindset of funders interested in supporting OSS, ordered roughly chronologically according to the point at which a funder should consider each concept. An alternative interpretation of rule organization is presented in Fig 1; this structural and conceptual representation may be more appealing for other audiences.
