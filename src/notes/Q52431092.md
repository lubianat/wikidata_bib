# Highlights

Single-cell transcriptomics15 provides a powerful platform for unbiased cell-type classification. Here we present ScarTrace, a single-cell sequencing strategy that enables the simultaneous quantification of clonal history and cell type for thousands of cells obtained from different organs of the adult zebrafish. 

he statistical confidence of each branch is computed as its proportion among 10,000 bootstrapped tree replicates. Only clones with more than 2 cells are taken into account
