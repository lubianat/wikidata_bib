# Highlights
As our experimentation remarks, in order to achieve the best performance on the datasets that are arranged in a tree-like structure, the classifier must feature an EfficientNetB5 backbone with an input size of  px, followed by a multilevel classifier. In addition, a Multiscale Crop data augmentation process must be carried out. Finally, the accuracy of this setup is a 62% top-1 accuracy and 88% top-5 accuracy. 


To train, test, and validate the architectures, we used the iNaturalist 2019 dataset as provided by the corresponding Kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/inaturalist-2019-fgvc6). 

As explained before, our goal is to provide the best architecture to perform multilevel classification from color images. Namely, given a taxonomic classification tree, the architectures predict the most probable category for each level of the mentioned tree taking a single color image as an input. An example of the prediction provided by our architectures is shown in Figure 4.
