# Highlights

Gilda is a software tool and web service that implements a scored string matching algorithm for names and synonyms across entries in biomedical ontologies covering genes, proteins (and their families and complexes), small molecules, biological processes and diseases. 

A further challenge is ambiguity, namely, that several entities can share the same name or synonym, and it is only based on broader context (a surrounding sentence or paragraph) that one can resolve which sense is implied.

Here, we present Gilda, a software tool and web service which integrates multiple biomedical lexical resources and implements a scored string matching algorithm [parts of which were adapted from the text tagger in Allen et al. (2015)] to names and synonyms across entries in these resources. 

Machine-learned models for context-aware disambiguation. Many entries integrated in Gilda’s resource table share a text name (e.g. ‘DAP4’ is a gene synonym for both DLGAP4 (DLG associated protein 4) and THAP12 (Death associated protein 4). These entries are textually equivalent and their status (i.e. synonym) is identical, therefore the scores assigned to them for a given input entity string will be the same.

BioCreative VI benchmark. We benchmarked Gilda on a grounding task with the BioCreative VI Track 1 (Bio-ID) da

Availability and integrations. Gilda is available as a Python package through PyPI, a Docker image through DockerHub and as a web application with a RESTful API at http://grounding.indra.bio. Gilda is integrated into INDRA (Gyori et al., 2017) to ground entity texts from knowledge sources where grounding is missing and to disambiguate entity strings from text mining. Gilda is also integrated into multiple web services and a human-machine dialogue system as described below.

Gilda is used in the INDRA Database web application (https://db.indra.bio) which allows searching for statements assembled by the INDRA system (Gyori et al., 2017)
