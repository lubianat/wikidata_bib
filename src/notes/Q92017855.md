# Highlights

Combined scRNA-seq analyses on the
tumor microenvironment in colorectal
cancer and murine tumor models identify
distinct myeloid populations that convey
differential sensitivity to CSF1R blockade
and define concerted immune responses
involving dendric cells and T cells upon
anti-CD40 treatment.

FCN1+ Monocyte-like cell

scRNA-seq analyses highlight conserved myeloid subsets in
human and murine CRC

Treatment with a CD40 agonist antibody preferentially
activated a cDC population and increased Bhlhe40+
Th1-like cells and CD8+ memory T cells. 

To define the major population and subpopulation structure of
the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, we performed graph-based
clustering (Butler et al., 2018) on these two datasets separately,
identifying the majority of known immune cell types, including
myeloid cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), T cells and B cells
(Figure S2A). Further unsupervised clustering in each compartment gave rise to a total of 38 and 36 leukocyte cell clusters
