# Highlights

any initiative too share raw clinical research data must also pay close attention to
sharing clear and complete information about the design of the
original studies.

We believe that the effective sharing of clinical research data requires the establishment of an
interoperable federated database system that includes both study design and results data. A key component of this system is a logical model of clinical study characteristics in which all the data ele- ments are standardized to controlled vocabularies and common ontologies to facilitate cross-study comparison and synthesis (4).

To complement work on defining and standardizing study design descriptions, national and international policies are still urgently needed to ensure effective, ethical, and coordinated sharing of tightly coupled study design and raw patient-level data (10).
