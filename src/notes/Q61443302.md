# Highlights

Moreover, we generate the first single cell integrated map of chromatin accessibility and transcriptome in early embryos and demonstrate the robustness of scCAT-seq in the precise dissection of master transcription factors in cells of distinct states

The regulation of these processes involves sequential events including the binding of TFs to cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and the recruitment of chromatin regulators, resulting in changes of chromatin structure and activation or repression of cell-type-specific genes


A comparison of our datasets with published profiles revealed that the differences across protocols and batches had a substantially smaller effect than difference across cell types (Supplementary Figure 2c, d).

By using clinically discarded human embryos (Methods), we generated scCAT-seq profiles for a total of 110 individual cells, and successfully obtained 29 quality-filtered profiles from the morula stage and 43 from the blastocyst stage (success rate 65.5%)
