# Highlights

Here, we present computational models
for cell type and tissue specification derived from
a collection of 921 RNA-sequencing samples from
272 distinct mouse cell types or tissues

his analysis also suggests that in total there are eight major
domains of cell type-specification, corresponding to
the neurectoderm, neural crest, surface ectoderm,
endoderm, mesoderm, blood mesoderm, germ cells
and the embryonic domain

--> Seems arbitrary

We reasoned that development leaves an ‘imprint’ upon
later cell types, and that this imprint would manifest as
lineage-specific gene expression programs that are maintained in adult tissues.

We became interested in using
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to understand the systematic
organization of cell type by understanding gene expression
programs in a global manner

--> As if there is a "true" systematic organization

Our results indicate the existence of new ‘domains’ of cell types, which are
distinct from the existing three germ layers. We propose the
division of the ectoderm into three domains (neurectoderm,
surface ectoderm and the neural crest), and the division of
the mesoderm into two new domains (the mesoderm proper
and the immune system/blood mesoderm)

--> 1.4.4

Moreover, although tissues are composed of a mix of cell types, evidence from the
C. elegans indicates that tissues and organs are mostly composed of cells derived from a single germ lineage (6,7), and
hence tissues may still be a useful dataset to extract global
patterns of organization from

Ultimately, the ability to profile the gene expression of single cells will reshape the concept of cell type identity (43,74,75) and enhance our understanding of the critical
concept of cell type.


# Comments
Lol, abbreviates cell type to C/T? Actually, no, I guess it is "cell type"/"Tissue"
I did not like the article very much.
