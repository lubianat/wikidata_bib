# Highlights

. Screening 46 candidate genes for astrocyte diversity across the mouse cortex, we identified superficial, mid and deep astrocyte identities in gradient layer patterns that were distinct from those of neurons.

multiplexed, branched-DNA, single-molecule, fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH)

layer-enriched neuron populations present across multiple cortical areas.

We next validated layer astrocyte gene expression in situ. To dis- tinguish astrocyte-specific gene expression by smFISH, we exam- ined markers for astrocytes (Aldh1l1, AldoC, Glast), neurons (Syt1, NeuN), oligodendrocytes (Pdgfra, Plp), microglia (Tmem119) and endothelia (Tie1).


To independently verify astrocyte layers, we examined the molecular heterogeneity of cortical astrocytes in a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) study.

our findings indicate a novel Rorb, Bcl11b L5 neuronal subtype in visual cortex, as well as molecular diversity of cortical gray matter astrocytes.

International collaboratives such as the Human Cell Atlas and BRAIN initiative have generated large repositories of gene expression data, and a logical next step is to map back such expression patterns in situ within developing tissues and/or mature organs.

LaST map showed reproducibility across multiple tissue samples/sections

Together, our findings indicate the diversification of astrocytes in layer patterns that diverge from excitatory neurons, indicating a composite ‘neuroglial’ cortical architecture with higher-order complexity.
