# Highlights

In single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis, clustering cells into groups and differentiating cell groups by differentially expressed (DE) genes are 2 separate steps for investigating cell identity. However, the ability to differentiate between cell groups could be affected by clustering

To accelerate this process, we have developed IKAPâ€”an algorithm to identify major cell groups and improve differentiating cell groups by systematically tuning parameters for clustering.

Examples of cell ontology proposed by IKAP. Three cell ontology examples were built by recursively running IKAP on the biggest groups (circled in red) for the mouse cortex dataset (A), PBMC_4K (D), and PBMC_8K
