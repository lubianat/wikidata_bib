# Highlights

We find that even two morphologically indistinguish- able, intermixed subclasses of medium spiny neu- rons display vastly different translational profiles and present examples of the physiological signifi- cance of such differences.

To tag polysomes in striatonigral and striatopallidal cells of the mouse striatum, we used homolo- gous recombination in bacteria to place EGFP-L10a under the control of either the Drd2 receptor (striatopallidal) or Drd1a receptor (striatonigral) loci in the appropriate BACs

EGFP direct fluorescence coincident with enkephalin immunohistochemical detection (striatopallidal cell marker) was observed in striatal cells from the Drd2 bac- TRAP line

For each cell type, data were collected from three independent biological replicates, each prepared from a cohort of seven animals


we investigated changes in mRNA translation of MSNs upon pharmacological perturbation of dopaminergic signaling using cocaine, a competitive inhibitor of the dopamine transporter, which acts as a psychostimulant by elevating syn- aptic dopamine levels

To determine whether the TRAP translational profiling methodol- ogy is generalizable, we produced cholinergic and Purkinjie cell-specific bacTRAP lines. To this end, the EGFP-L10a trans- gene was placed under the control of the choline acetyltransferase (Chat) locus, specifically expressed in cholinergic cells in the CNS, or the Purkinje cell protein 2 (Pcp2) locus, specifically expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells of the CNS.

the information obtained is cell type-specific while abrogating the physiologic adaptations and mRNA degradation that can occur during the lengthy cell separation procedures used in other approaches that sever neuronal axons and dendrites and disrupt tissue- intrinsic signaling.

An accompanying study (Doyle et al., 2008) has dem- onstrated the general applicability of the TRAP methodology by characterizing additional CNS cell types, each of which ex- hibits an enormously complex and cell-type specific molecular phenotype.
