# Highlights

The toolkit contains the following four elements: 1) an annual report form of quantitative data to be completed by OS partnership administrators; 2) a series of semi-structured interview guides of stakeholders; 3) a survey form of participants in OS collaborations; and 4) a set of other quantitative measures best collected by other organizations, such as research foundations and governmental or intergovernmental agencies.

We begin with a literature review outlining the rationale for our methodology and our conceptual approach. We then describe the development of the measures. We end with a call to the larger community to comment upon and improve the proposed measures and to begin implementing them.

Our aim, in this article, is to propose measures that enable hypothesis-driven research on the influence and impact of OS partnerships
