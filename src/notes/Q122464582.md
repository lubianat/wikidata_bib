# Highlights

We built a cohort of 138,818 individuals
with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 5,985,227 noninfected control group from the
US Department of Veterans Afairs and followed them for 2 years to estimate
the risks of death and 80 prespecifed postacute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC)

<!-- Nice, simple dataviz, though dates should be in different places, to indicate data is for the range.-->

. Heatmaps include (top row) nonhospitalized for COVID-19 during the
acute phase of the disease (n = 118,238) corresponding to each sequela and
(bottom row) COVID-19 hospitalization during the acute phase of the disease
(n = 20,580).
r time periods of 30–90, 91–180, 181–360, 361–540 and
541–720 day 


<!-- Cardiac arrest data is VERY impressive. Cholangitis is the largest continued ristk for hospitalized patients (and seemingly null for non-hospitalized). 


non-hospitalized, risks seem to be generally low, that is great! Very slight increase for gastritis, headaches and  cough. The others are significant, but irrelevant. -->

infection. 

<!-- Not good! Non-hospitalized and Hostpitalized patients had VERY different outcomes. Putting them together introduces confusion. -->


s. The findings show that among people who were
nonhospitalized during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (this
group represents the majority of people with COVID-19), the risk of
death becomes nonstatistically significant at 6 months (possible range
of risk horizon: 3–12 months) after infection and the risk of hospitalization remains elevated until 19 months (12–24 months) after infection. 

<!-- Statistically significant, but the effect size is kind of small, 1.3 u >
