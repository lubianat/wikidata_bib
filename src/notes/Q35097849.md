# Highlights
 Our approach enhances a previous extension to LBD, called “discovery browsing,” and is implemented using Semantic MEDLINE, which summarizes the results of a PubMed search into an interactive graph of semantic predications. The methodology allows a user to construct argumentation underpinning an answer to a biomedical question by engaging the user in an iterative process between system output and user knowledge.

 Our goal is to use literature-based discovery (LBD) to elucidate the paradox that obesity has a beneficial effect in critical care, although it contributes to disease generally. 

 In previous research on using serendipitous knowledge discovery (SKD) for LBD21 we exploited four themes: an iteration of searches, change or clarification of search parameters progressively through the iterations, a seeker’s prior knowledge to provide meaning and relevance to information in search results, and the role of information organization and presentation. I

 increased obesity has been found to be a predictor of decreased mortality and morbidity in several, principally critical, conditions, including acute coronary syndrome23, heart failure24, stroke25, and respiratory emergencies26, as well as a general ICU phenomenon27.
