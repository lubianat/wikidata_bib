Table 3 BIO(−) labeling for the discontinuous and overlapping ontology class mentions in the phrase “red and white blood cells” (from PMCID:15314655)

The underlying target representation for all algorithms are BIO tags [10], which are used to label each word in the sequence as beginning (B), inside (I), or outside (O) an ontological concept mention; for example, the BIO tagging for the text mentions “red blood cells" and “white blood cells" in the phrase “red and white blood cells" can be seen in Table 3.

or example, the text mention “white blood cell" is normalized to the class ID CL:0000738 and the text mention “red ... blood cell" to the class ID CL:0000232 (see Fig. 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to reframe and explore this task as a translation problem by translating the characters of all the text mentions to the characters of the ontology class identifiers.

 s. Then for each text mention, the output is the class ID, similarly in the form of characters (e.g., for the input “w h i t e b l o o d c e l l", the output is “C L : 0 0 0 0 7 3 8" including the ontology namespace and the colon). Analogously, the output size is the maximum number of characters among the ontology class IDs, with added null characters if the sequence is shorter (e.g., “CL:0000738" has 10 characters)

 By reframing concept recognition as a translation problem, we not only sidestep the multi-class classification problem, but also achieve above or near state-of-the-art performance (see Tables 5 and 6) on the concept annotation task of the CRAFT Shared Task with direct comparison to Furrer et al. [4] via the corresponding evaluation framework. 

 The alphabetical-ids approach did not outperform the token-ids approach, and the performance is most likely dependent on how alphabetical the concepts in each ontology are. For example, the concepts “HaC" (CL:0000855) and “haematopoietic cell" (CL:0000988) have quite different class IDs but are very close in the alphabetization of the CL classes
