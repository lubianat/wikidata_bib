# Highlights

Compared tode novo(unsupervised) clustering meth-ods, we demonstrate using multiple benchmarks that supervisedclustering, which uses reference transcriptomes as a guide, is ro-bust to batch effects.
RCA2  is  implemented  in  R  and  is  available  atgithub.com/prabhakarlab/RCAv2

  All  matricesare represented assparse matrixR objects. 


RCA2 implements cell type as-signment at the SC level following a strategy inspired by SIN-GLER (Sup. Section 2.2). To annotate cell types on the clus-ter level, we consider the cell type composition for each clus-ter based on the SC cell type assignment described above. Ifthe cell type distribution within a cluster is heterogeneous andthe proportion of the major cell type is below a user definedthreshold (default50%), the cluster is labelled asUnknown.


Next, we pinpointed the location of the206developing neu-trophils(DN)  annotated  by  Wilket al.within  our  RCA2UMAP,  and  found  these  cells  to  be  a  mixture  of  differentcell types (Fig.6b).  Similar to the initial SingleR annota-tion for theDNcluster made by Wilket al.,131cells werepositioned within theMyelocyte & Neugroup, which consis-tently showed high expression of premature neutrophil gran-ule genes in our RCA2 analysis (Sup.   Fig.   32a). 

a) Cluster-specific QC based on NODG and pMito. Colors indicates whether cells are discarded (red, blue) or retained (black) if general, cluster-unspecific QC wouldbe used.

Overall,   we   demonstrated   that   reference-based   cluster-ing  of  scRNA-seq  data  has  unique  advantages  and  pro-vides  a  complementary  strategy  to  widely-used  unsuper-vised  approaches.RCA2,  which  is  freely  available  ongithub   (https://github.com/prabhakarlab/RCAv2)
