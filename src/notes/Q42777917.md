# Highlights

 Here, we directly measure the effects of aging in human tissue by performing single-cell transcriptome analysis of 2,544 human pancreas cells from eight donors spanning six decades of life

 Studies on CAG repeats in mouse brain (Gonitel et al., 2008) have shown that age-dependent somatic mutation rates in post-mitotic cells might be higher than previously anticipated. Because these mutational processes operate in chronological time rather than number of cell divisions, an analysis of human cells from a large age span rather than from short-lived model organisms is needed. 

Analysis of Single Nucleotide Variants in scRNA-Seq Data Reveals Cell-Type-Specific Somatic Substitutions and Neuronal mRNA Editing

. Consistent with mRNA editing being specific to neurons, T > C substitutions in GRIA2 occurred almost exclusively in brain cells. A more precise analysis of the GRIA2 splice sites confirmed this because these sites were highly enriched in T > C
