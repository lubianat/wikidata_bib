# Highlights

we perform scRNAseq in six PAs using methods that enabled detection of the rearrangement

These data indicate that MAPK signaling is restricted to relatively undifferentiated cancer cells in PA, with implications for investigational therapies directed at this pathway.

PA cancer cells recapitulate a developmental differentiation hierarchy from OPC-like cells to mature astrocyte-like cells
We detected evidence for CNVs in single cells from a subset of PAs. CNVs were inferred from PA cancer cell scRNA-seq data by averaging expression over contiguous stretches of 100 genes
