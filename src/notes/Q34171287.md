# Highlights
Across circuits, brain regions and species, there is growing evidence of a link between synaptic co-activation and dendritic location, although this finding is not universal. The functional implications of input clustering and future challenges are discussed.

Collectively, existing and in-progress tools for structural and functional connectome analysis appear poised to produce a mountain of data in the near future.

This begs the question … what is the question?
“This play with probabilities is legitimate only if synapses between cortical neurons are made entirely by chance, depending only on the accident of some axon of one neuron coming into the immediate vicinity of some dendrite of another”. V. Braitenberg et al., Cortex: Statistics and Geometry of Neuronal Connectivity, 1998.


There are two general models for how neurons integrate synaptic input. In a global integration model, PSPs resulting from individual synapses sum linearly at the soma. Supporting this, studies combining whole-cell patch clamp and activation of two dendritic locations using synaptic stimulation or glutamate iontophoresis observed linear summation (e.g., Cash and Yuste, 1999; Araya et al., 2006).
