# Highlights
Today, there are some estimates for the cell numbers in the whole brain of several species (Lange,
1975; Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006, 2007), but how much do we know about the density of cells
in each brain region? How much do we know about the density of specific cell-types in each brain
region? How reliable are the estimates that have been reported?

Relevant papers reported several types of numbers: cell
density, numbers of neurons in a particular structure as counted
stereologically, or numbers of neurons in a slice or sampling
region. Most studies do not directly study adult wild type mice
as an end in itself, but instead test an experimental modification.

Even within a region, cell densities can vary across the
structure.
n expansion microscopy method
has been used to identify the cell bodies of cells in the brain
and construct a 3D atlas, the CUBIC-Atlas (Murakami et al.,
2018). A microscopic technique that directly counts cells labeled
with multiple markers has potential allow cell-type specific
registration in space (Frasconi et al., 2014). In all such efforts,
alignment to a standard reference atlas is critical.
