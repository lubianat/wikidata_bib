# Highlights
Novel technologies including lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revolutionized our understanding of subtypes of monocyte- and VSMC-derived foam cells. By using scRNA-seq, three main clusters including resident-like, inflammatory, and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (Trem2hi) are identified as the major subtypes of monocyte-derived foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques

 Since the 1960s, macrophages are classified in M1 and M2 subtypes (26). It has been extensively accepted that M1 macrophages trigger and participate in the inflammation process while M2 macrophages are anti-inflammatory (27, 28).
