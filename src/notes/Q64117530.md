# Highlights

Clustering of >30,000 single cells identified >30 populations representing nine cell lineages, including a previously undescribed fibroblast lineage trajectory present in both sham and MI hearts leading to a uniquely activated cell state defined in part by a strong anti-WNT transcriptome signature. We also uncovered novel myofibroblast subtypes expressing either pro-fibrotic or anti-fibrotic signatures

of ECs (EC1, EC2, EC3), comprising vascular and lymphatic lineages (Pecam1+Kdr+Ly6a+) (Figure 1D; Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). The majority EC1 population expressed Ly6a (encoding SCA1) as well as the vascular transcription factor (TF) Sox17, and likely represents microvascular ECs. EC2 expressed canonical arterial endothelial markers such as Bmx, Sema3g and Efnb2, as well as TF genes Sox17 and Hey1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B), the latter acting downstream of NOTCH which is required for arterial EC fate. EC3 almost uniquely expressed venous EC marker Nr2f2 (encoding COUPTFII) and Von Willebrand factor (Vwf), and a minority (~3%) expressed Prox1 and Lyve1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B), consistent with a lymphatic identity. 

--> Did not subdivide the population...

Expression of mouse genes encoding cognates of human CD14 and CD16/FCGR3, previously used to define classical, non-classical and intermediate Mo in human blood (Villani et al., 2017), did not help to discrimate the above Mo/MΦ populations

--> Mice are not Humans

In sham conditions, two major fibroblast populations could be distinguished on the basis of scRNA-seq. We termed these Fibroblast-Sca1-high (F-SH) and Fibroblast-Sca1-low (F-SL)
