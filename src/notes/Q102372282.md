# Highlights
MGD is the primary source for official gene,allele, and mouse strain nomenclature based on theguidelines  set  by  the  International  Committee  onStandardized Nomenclature for Mice. MGD’s biocu-ration scientists curate information from the biomed-ical literature and from large and small datasets con-tributed directly by investigators. 

In this report we describe significant enhancements toMGD, including two new graphical user interfaces: (i) im-provements to the Multiple Genome Viewer for exploringthe genomes of multiple mouse strains (ii) enhancement andinclusion of information of now over 64 000 strains of miceincluding collaborative cross strains and (iii) incorporationof SNP data with extensive updates in query and visualiza-tion of variant×strain data

he subset of papers about mice that are relevant to MGD(i.e. those focused on genetics and genomics of the labora-tory mouse) continues to remain relatively stable year byyear. In each of 2018 and 2019 we curated∼12 000 pa-pers primarily from a core set of 120 journals. Our litera-ture acquisition process involves using full text search forthe word ‘mice’ from this core set of journals to find poten-tially relevant articles which are then downloaded as PDFfiles.
