# Highlights
This paper describes scispaCy, a new Python library and models for practical biomedical/scientific text processing, which heavily leverages the spaCy library.

We retrain spaCy3 models for POS tagging, dependency parsing, and NER using datasets relevant to biomedical text, and enhance the tokenization module with additional rules

In this data release, we also align the converted dependency parses to their original text spans in the raw, untokenized abstracts from the original release, and include the PubMed metadata for the abstracts which was discarded in the GENIA corpus released by McClosky and Charniak (2008). We hope that this raw format can emerge as a resource for practical evaluation in the biomedical domain of core NLP tasks such as tokenization, sentence segmentation and joint models of syntax.

The main NER model in both released packages in scispaCy is trained on the mention spans in the MedMentions dataset (Murty et al., 2018).

To generate candidate entities for linking a given mention, we use an approximate nearest neighbours search over our subset of UMLS concepts and concept aliases and output the entities associated with the nearest K.

During development of the candidate generator, we noticed that abbreviated mentions account for a substantial proportion of the failure cases where none of the generated candidates match the correct entity. To partially remedy this, we implement the unsupervised abbreviation detection algorithm of Schwartz and Hearst (2002), substituting mention candidates marked as abbreviations for their long form definitions before searching for their nearest neighbours.

abbreviated names and noun compounds containing punctuation are more common, whilst the wide range of citation styles can easily be misidentified as sentence boundaries

Apache cTakes (Savova et al., 2010) was designed specifically for clinical notes rather than the broader biomedical domain. 
MetaMap and MetaMapLite (Aronson, 2001; Demner-Fushman et al., 2017) from the National Library of Medicine focus specifically on entity linking using the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)
The GENIA Tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2005) provides the closest comparison to scispaCy due to itâ€™s multi-stage pipeline,

In this paper we presented several robust model pipelines for a variety of natural language processing tasks focused on biomedical text. 

Future work on scispaCy will include a more fully featured entity linker built from the current candidate generation work, as well as other pipeline components such as negation detection commonly used in the clinical and biomedical natural language processing communities.
