# Highlights

We present an open education resource that updates the traditional plant collection exercise to incorporate best practices in twenty-first century collecting and to contextualize the activities that build data acumen. Students exposed to this resource gained skills and content knowledge in plant taxonomy and systematics, as well as a nuanced understanding of collections-based data resources

Observations of organisms contributed by community scientists are growing via portals such as iNaturalist and the US National Phenology Network.

Our module employed the iNaturalist platform (www.iNaturalist.org) for recording data and images at the site of the collecting event, as has become popular with professional botanists (e.g., Heberling and Isaac 2018). From inception, we sought to engage in the scholarship of teaching with the goal of publishing our assessed and vetted educational materials. We were deliberate in developing online educational materials in the spirit of open science and FAIR practices (for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable; Wilkinson et al. 2016, Garcia et al. 2020).
