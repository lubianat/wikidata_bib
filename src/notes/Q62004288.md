# Highlights

However, its web interface is mainly intended for inspection of small networks and their underlying evidence. The Cytoscape software, on the other hand, is much better suited for working with large networks and offers greater flexibility in terms of network analysis, import, and visualization of additional data. To include both resources in the same workflow, we created stringApp, a Cytoscape app that makes it easy to import STRING networks into Cytoscape

Together this makes STRING and Cytoscape a perfect
match, especially for analysis of proteomics data; indeed, more
than thousand papers in PubMed Central mention both
STRING and Cytoscape

the app provides the look and many of the features of the
STRING web interface within Cytoscape

Instead of ﬁrst loading
large amounts of data from one or more databases into
memory and then executing the algorithms, we were able to
implement the algorithms in Structured Query Language
(SQL) and execute them directly within the PostgreSQL
database engine. We made use of this approach for two
algorithms used by stringApp.

Network Expansion. This algorithm adds N additional
nodes to the network based on their total connectivity to a
current selection of nodes (X) relative to their overall
connectivity in the STRING database


Nevertheless, stringApp also imports protein−protein inter-
actions from STRING for a disease or PubMed query of
interest as well as protein−chemical interaction data from
STITCH. A list of the main stringApp features can be found in
Table 1.
