# Highlights

We developed flowCL, a software package that performs semantic labelling of cell populations based on their surface markers.
By providing automated labelling of cell populations based on their immunophenotype, flowCL allows for unambiguous and reproducible identification of standardized cell types.

However, multiple issues arose when we attempted to use the CL for labelling of cell types derived from FCM data

To address these challenges, we developed flowCL, a software package that enables researchers to unambiguously label their cell populations based on their immunophenotype using the CL.

The steps flowCL takes are as follows: 
- A SPARQL (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) query against the CL fetches the labels and IDs corresponding to the input markers by text matching to the label or synonyms fields in the CL;
- The marker labels are used to retrieve a list of cell types that contain (or lack) the marker labels; 
- The set of markers that make up each cell type is then retrieved;
- A final query retrieves all parents up to the root of the CL for each cell type to build a tree diagram of the results.

By providing automated labelling of cell populations based on their immunophenotype, flowCL allows researchers to report results using cell type labels.
