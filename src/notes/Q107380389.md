# Highlights
The   US   Brain  Initiative   Cell   Census   Network,   Human   Cell   Atlas,   Blue   Brain   Project,   and   others   are   generating  vast   amounts   of   data   and   characterizing   large   numbers   of   neurons   throughout   the   nervous  system.   

Here,   we   propose   an   interoperable   knowledge  representation,   the   Neuron   Phenotype   Ontology   (NPO)   that   provides   a   standardized   and  machine   computable   approach   for   naming   and   normalizing   phenotypes   in   cell   types   by   using  community   ontology   identifiers   as   a   common   language.  

The   NPO   provides   a   framework   for  systematically   organizing   knowledge   about   cellular   properties   and   enables   interoperability   with  existing   neuron   naming   schemes.   

We evaluate   the   NPO   by   populating   a   knowledge   base   with  three   independent   cortical   neuron   classifications   derived   from   published   data   sets   that   describe  neurons   according   to   molecular,   morphological,electrophysiological   and   synaptic   properties.  Competency   queries   to   this   knowledge   base   demonstrate   that   this   knowledge   model   enables  interoperability   between   the   three   test   cases   and   common   usage   neuron   names   from   the  literature.
