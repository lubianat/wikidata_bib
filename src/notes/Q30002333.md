========================================================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q30002333]  
  
Publication date : 23 of February, 2017  

# Highlights

EXTRACT 2.0 expands the scope of the tool in several new
directions with the aim to make it more broadly useful.
We expanded the scope from covering only diseases to covering phenotypes in general. To this end, we complemented
the existing disease dictionary with terms from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MPO)

The tool, API, and documentation are freely accessible at http://extract.jensenlab.org/.
# Comments

Not much advance from first edition. Code is missing, that sucks.
