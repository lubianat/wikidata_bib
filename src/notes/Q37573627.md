# Highlights

Oligodendrocytes are best known for their ability to myelinate brain neurons, thus increasing the speed of signal transmission. Marques et al. surveyed oligodendrocytes of developing mice and found unexpected heterogeneity. 

(fig. S10) (15).
Myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (MFOL1 and
MFOL2) expressed genes responsible for myelin
formation (Mal, Mog, Plp1, Opalin, and Serinc5)
(fig. S1, A and B).

Fig. 4. Region- and age-specific distribution of mature oligodendrocytes. (A) t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding projections, as in Fig. 2A,
with colored dots representing cells from each of the 10 CNS regions analyzed. (B) Age distribution of oligodendrocyte populations in the S1 cortex and
corpus callosum. Bar plots show the percentage of each population by age. Red, juvenile brain; blue, adult brain
