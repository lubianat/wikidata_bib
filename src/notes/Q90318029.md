# Highlights

Multiple  myeloma,  a  plasma  cell  malignancy,  is  the  second  most  common  blood  cancer
We identify extensive subclonal structures for 10 of 29 individuals with mul-tiple myeloma. In asymptomatic individuals with early disease and in those with minimal residual disease post-treatment, we detect  rare  tumor  plasma  cells  with  molecular  characteristics  similar  to  those  of  active  myeloma,  with  possible  implications  for  personalized  therapies.

We characterized 20,586 single plasma cells from the bone marrow and 3,540 single plasma  cells  from  the  blood  of  11  control  individuals  and  29  sub-jects  newly  diagnosed  with  multiple  myeloma.
