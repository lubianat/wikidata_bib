# Highlights

. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companiesoffer the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low cost without the need to consult a physician orgeneticist. Over 100,000 people have already been genotyped through Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies.However, this data is not public for a variety of reasons and thus cannot be used in research. It seems reasonable to create acentral open data repository for such data. Here we present the web platform openSNP, an open database which allowsparticipants of Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing to publish their genetic data at no cost along with phenotypicinformation. Through this crowdsourced effort of collecting genetic and phenotypic information, openSNP has become aresource for a wide area of studies, including Genome-Wide Association Studies. openSNP is hosted at http://www.opensnp.org, and the code is released under MIT-license at http://github.com/gedankenstuecke/snpr.


GWAS are not only performed inside the traditional scientificcommunity. Since 2006, companies like 23andMe, deCODEmeor FamilyTreeDNA have been offering Direct-To-Consumer(DTC) genetic testing. These companies use DNA microarraysto screen for around 0.5 to 1 million SNPs spread over the humangenome. In return, customers receive an analysis of the results, aswell as a raw file that includes the customer’s individual genotypes.In 2011, 23andMe alone had over 100,000 customers [10].

Additionally, not everycustomer of DTC genetic testing can participate in thePersonalGenome  Project, as their consent forms only allow residents of theUnited States to apply

Here, we present openSNP, an online platform which enablesDTC customers to share genotypic and phenoytypic information,as well as receive additional information on their genotypes. Thegenotypes are made available to researchers via the open CreativeCommons Zero license.


We created the openSNP project (http://opensnp.org) as anopen, crowdsourced online platform for DTC customers interestedin sharing their raw data 

--> Cool, site is still up!

Currently users can upload their genotyping results from thecompanies23andMe,deCODEmeandFamilyTreeDNAvia a webinterface to the openSNP project.
Due to spaceconstraints on the database level, openSNP currently only displaysthe SNPs of the exome data sets on the website but the whole VCFfiles can be downloaded.

The uploaded data is published under theCreative Commons Zero license, which – in accordance with thePanton Principles [25] 

--> Nice
