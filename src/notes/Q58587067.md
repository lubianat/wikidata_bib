# Highlights
The DO project's data content Creative Commons licensing has been updated from CC BY 3.0 (Attribution) to CC0 (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (the most open license), as of 5 April 2017, to enhance collaboration and data sharing and to encourage broad and open usage. 

<!-- Nice!! -->

50 OMIM, 1491 GARD (rare disease) (38) and 655 MeSH cross references identified by Wikidata users, extracted from Wikidata database and validated by the DO team.
<!--     - 1.3.3. Wikidata as a platform for representation of biological knowledge: -->

The tissue and cell of origin axioms (logical definitions) enable querying and enhanced views of the DO with logical definitions associated with OBO Foundry ontologies), UBERON (anatomy) and the Cell Ontology (cell types) (41). 

The DO user community has continued to expand over the past three years, in addition to adoption of the DO by the Model Organism Databases (MOD),

The first set of inferred disease classifications will be expanded to include inferred disease classification hierarchies for genetic, inheritance, symptom, phenotype, transmission method and pathogenic agent. For example, observable characteristics or traits (phenotypic traits) from the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (44) will define logical axioms with the ‘has_phenotype’ relation for phenotypes of syndromes and genetic diseases.
