# Highlights
 Here we used single-cell RNA-seq4â€“7 at multiple time points to dissect direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced neuronal (iN) cells

Moreover, a transcriptional state, distinct from donor and target cell programs, is transiently induced in cells undergoing productive reprogramming. Our data provide a high-resolution approach for understanding transcriptome states during lineage differentiation.

Using the three transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l (BAM), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) can be directly reprogrammed to induced neuronal (iN) cells within 2 to 3 weeks at an efficiency of up to 20%

We observed that the up-regulation of neuronal targets and down-regulation of cell cycle genes in response to Ascl1 expression are uniform, indicating that the initial transcriptional response to Ascl1 is relatively homogenous among all cells (Figure 1e). This suggests that most fibroblasts are initially competent to reprogram and later events must be responsible for the moderate reprogramming efficiency of about 20%.

. We identified 3 clusters, which contained cells expressing neuron (Syp), fibroblast (Eln), or myocyte (Tnnc2) marker genes

After 7 days of reprogramming, TauGFP reporter MEFs (with C57BL/6J and 129S4/SvJae background) are co-cultured with glia derived from CD-1 mice.

R studio38 (https://www.rstudio.com/) was used to run custom R39 scripts to perform principal component analys

We used Pearson correlation of each single cell expression profile with the expression profile of bulk cortical neurons 13,24, myocytes25, and MEFs13 to further estimate the identity of each single cell and to estimate when alternative fates emerge.
