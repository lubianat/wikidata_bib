# Highlights

To facilitate efficient metadata curation, we developed an easy-to-use   web-based   curation   application,   GEOMetaCuration,   for   curating   the   metadataof  Gene  Expression  Omnibus  datasets.

The  application  is  based  on  a  commonly  used  web  developmentframework of Python/Django and is open-sourced under the GNU General Public LicenseV3.  GEOMetaCuration  is  expected  to  benefit  the  biocuration  community  and  to  con-tribute  to  computational  generation  of  biological  insights  using  large-scale  biologicaldata. An example use case can be found at the demo website: http://geometacuration.yubiolab.org.


Metadata  curation  is  an  essential  step  for  analyzing  and integrating  heterogeneous  large-scale  biological  datasetsgenerated  by  numerous  labs  across  the  world

For ex-ample, there are more than 100 000 datasets in one of themost  popular  public  databases  for  functional  genomicsdata, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

But  the  curation  process  still  involves  manymechanical and tedious operations interspersed throughout.Curators  are  required  to  collect  information  scattered  inmultiple places for each curation task to reach a correct con-clusion

Tomakeitfreelyaccessible,GEOMetaCuration  is  published  under  the  GNU  GeneralPublic License V3. Its source code can be freely downloadedat https://bitbucket.com/yubiolab/GEOMetaCuration.

--> That is really good, thank you!

Figure 6.Time spent on mechanical operations required for curation ofeach  of  20  datasets.  GEOMetaCuration  significantly  reduces  curationtime  by  eliminating  mechanical  operations  like  opening  webpages,searching  important  information,  and  typing  in  results.  The  webpagecaching feature further reduces curation time by avoiding repetitive re-quests to GEO, PubMed, and PMC. **** indicatesP<0.0001 (one-sidedt-test).



--> That is a good user metric test
