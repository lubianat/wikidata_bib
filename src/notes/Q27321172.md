# Highlights

. Here we generated transcriptomes for 301 single cells from the utricular and
cochlear sensory epithelia of newborn mice to circumvent this challenge
Comparisons of cell types from utricles
and cochleae demonstrate divergence between auditory and vestibular cells, despite a
common origin.

Each of these epithelia contains two primary cell types, hair
cells (HCs) and supporting cells (SCs)

RNA-Seq of single cells from inner ear sensory epithelia. The
recent development of microﬂuidics-based protocols for the
capture of single cells and subsequent generation of high-quality
complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries provides a novel method
for the identiﬁcation of HC and SC subtypes, as only a few
thousand isolated cells are required for capture 2
