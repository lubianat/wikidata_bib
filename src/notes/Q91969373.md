# Highlights

 We found selective vulnerability and loss of excitatory CUX2-expressing projection neurons in upper-cortical layers underlying meningeal inflammation; such MS neuron populations exhibited upregulation of stress pathway genes and long non-coding RNAs

 Notably, single-nucleus RNA sequencing identified phagocytosing microglia and/or macrophages by their ingestion and perinuclear import of myelin transcripts, confirmed by functional mouse and human culture assays

 Neuronal-subtype markers included the excitatory neuron (EN) marker SLC17A7, upper-layer marker CUX2, layer 4 marker RORB, deep-layer marker TLE4, as well as interneuron (IN) marker GAD2 and subtype markers PVALB, SST, VIP and SV2C.


 CUX2-expressing L2–L3 ENs

 We next used large area spatial transcriptomic (LAST) mapping19 to validate cell-type-specific changes in gene expression

 CD44 was upregulated at the lesion rim in astrocytes that co-expressed CRYAB and MT325 (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). RFX4 expression was specific to the astrocyte lineage and captured all SLC1A2-expressing GM astrocytes and CD44-expressing WM astrocytes 

 Conversely, we observed downregulation of markers for OL differentiation and myelin synthesis (BCAS1, SGMS1)29, potassium–cation homeostasis (KCNJ10)26, cell–cell interaction (SEMA6A) and formation of the node of Ranvier (GLDN) in MS OLs at lesion borders (Fig. 4h).

Markers of stressed CUX2-expressing neurons included PPIA (which encodes cyclophilin A) and NORAD, a neuronal lncRNA that helps to stabilize DNA following genomic stress by binding to pumilio and RBMX proteins
