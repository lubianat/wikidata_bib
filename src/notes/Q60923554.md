# Highlights
After manually reviewing more than 2500 published literature, we collected the cancer-related lncRNAs with the experimental proof of functions. By integrating from literature and public databases, we constructed CRlncRNA, a database of cancer-related lncRNAs.

We also provided tools for data browsing, searching and download, as well as online BLAST, genome browser and gene network visualization service.

CRlncRNA is freely available for all users at http://crlnc.xtbg.ac.cn.

With this user-friendly interface as well as the highly valuable molecular and clinicopathological data, we believe CRlncRNA could serve as a productive tool for researchers in the field of lncRNA and cancer.
