# Highlights

Here, we present OnClass, an algorithm and accompanying software for automatically classifying cells into cell types part of the controlled vocabulary that forms the Cell Ontology. It uses the Cell Ontology graph to infer cell type relationships.

OnClass can be used not only as an annotation tool for single cell datasets but also as an algorithm to identify marker genes specific to each term of the Cell Ontology, offering the possibility of refining the Cell Ontology using a data-centric approach.

The Cell Ontology offers a controlled vocabulary for cell types and has been proposed as the basis for consistently annotating large-scale single-cell atlases.

Assigning cells to terms (i.e., cell types) in the Cell Ontology has at least three challenges:

- most of these cell type terms are not associated with marker genes.
- supervised learning approaches can be used to predict Cell Ontology terms that have curated annotations, they are unable to classify cells to unseen terms
- The Cell Ontology is not developed specifically for scRNA-seq, it likely misses new cell types and cell states and so certain cell type relationships might be inaccurate

Since OnClass annotated cells even to previously unseen Cell Ontology terms according to the annotated cells from other Cell Ontology terms, its performance greatly relied on the quality of cell type embeddings.

In the state-of-the-art single-cell integration frameworks, datasets from different technologies are aligned in the same low-dimensional space by using mutual nearest neighbors as anchors to connect them. Indeed, our method can be considered to be aligning the Cell Ontology to the gene expression matrix by using known annotations as anchors
