# Highlights
An agranular cell type in the anterior pituitary first described by Rinehart and Farquhar in 1953 (1) was named the folliculo-stellate (FS) cell on the basis of appearance (agranular and stellate), location (surrounding follicles), and positive immunostaining for the S-100 protein (2). 

. Generation of a FS cell line called TtT/GF (9) has greatly facilitated work on the properties of these cells. TtT/GF cells stimulated in vitro by the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) secrete the cytokine IL-6 via a nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-dependent pathway (10).

Macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine, is classically found in lymphoid tissues but is also produced by specific pituitary cell types
