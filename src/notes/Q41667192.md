# Highlights

Here we use imaging to track granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) behaviour in mice during emergency and leukaemic myelopoiesis

We took advantage of the phenotypic characteristics of GMPs (Lin−c-Kit+Sca-1−FcγR+CD34+)5 to design an immunofluorescence staining scheme allowing their specific recognition on isolated populations and bone sections (Extended Data Fig. 1a).

Similar investigations with leukaemic GMPs revealed a molecular signature of expanding pGMPs in GMPs from both BA and jB mice, with increased Ccne1 expression and decreased levels of Irf8, Csf1r (also known as M-CSFR) and Il6ra
