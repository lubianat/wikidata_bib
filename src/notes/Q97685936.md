# Highlights

 Officially approved drug package inserts list the adverse reactions identifiedfrom randomized controlled clinical trials with high evidence levels and worldwide postmarketing surveillance. Formalrepresentation of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) enclosed in semistructured package inserts will enable deep recognition ofside effects and rational drug use, substantially reduce morbidity, and decrease societal costs.

a generic ADR ontology model is proposed from two dimensions(and nine subdimensions), covering the ADR information and medication instructions

We collected 165 package inserts of quinolone drugs from the National Medical Products Administration and otherdrug databases in China, and built a specialized ADR ontology containing 2879 classes and 15,711 semantic relations. 

Package inserts (sometimes called patient information leaflets)are the primary official papers which accompany mostprescribed drugs and over-the-counter medications

Several studies about building ontologies for ADRs for differentapplications have  already been carried out. For instance, theAdverse Drug Reaction Classification System (ADReCS) wasdeveloped as a comprehensive ADR ontology database, whichenabled standardization and provided hierarchical classificationof ADR terms for a molecular understanding of drug safety inthe laboratory, and use in bioinformatics and systems biologyfor toxicological research [27].  Additionally,  an ontology ofADRs (OADRs) was built to describe the semantics of ADRterms for automated signal generation in pharmacovigilance[28].

The proposed ADR ontology can be generalized to organize theADR information from other channels, not just package inserts.Electronic health records, in which the ADR data are frequentlyreported, will be acquired for the enrichment of the ADRontology in the near future.
