The definition of cell type
===========================
  
  [@wikidata:Q77807915]  

# Highlights

What do we mean by “cell type?” 

We know that cultured smooth muscle cells obtained in different ways have different stable phenotypes. These results suggested that the cultures somehow represent a model for the cells forming the neointima in vivo.

One implication of definitive analyses of gene expression should be a redefinition of what we mean by cell type. Currently “cell type” is defined, in most cases, either by morphology or by a small number of genes that have been identified with that tissue.

In summary, biology is changing. We have the tools to explore hypothesis-based studies in increasingly minute detail. At the same time, systematic exploration will provide us with more pathways to be defined. As such studies proceed, the functional map will get more and more complex. The challenge will be to discriminate critical mechanistic steps from less important details.


# Comments


"These studies, taken together, illustrate a major change in how we define cell type, a change that is about to be accelerated by the power of systematic genomics" 

--> Early description of how transcriptomics would change our view of cell type diversity

Addresses a bit of the difference between native cell types and cultured cell types.
