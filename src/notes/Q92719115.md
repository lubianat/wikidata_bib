# Highlights

Omics-based approaches can be used to study the vast
nanomaterial chemical space as well as the biological factors that affect the
safety, toxicity, and efficacy of nanotechnologies. The generation and analysis
of large datasets, methods to interpret them, and dataset applications to
nanomaterials to date, are demonstrated here. Finally, new approaches for
how sequencing-generated datasets can answer fundamental questions in
nanotechnology based drug delivery are proposed.
