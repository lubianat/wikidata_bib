SourceData: a semantic platform for curating and searching figures.
===================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q48094767]  

# Highlights
A platform that allows researchers and publishers to share scientific figures and (when available) underlying source data in a way that is machine readable and findable.

Listing the biological entities involved in an experiment and, second, by categorizing them into broad experimental roles.

As proof of principle, we have curated a compendium of over 18,000 experiments published across 23 journals. From the 721 papers processed, 381 papers were related to the field of autophagy, and the rest were annotated during the publication process of accepted manuscripts at four partner molecular biology journals

(see http://smartfigures.net for a demonstration of SmartFigure integration into published papers)

To facilitate the interrogation of the SourceData database, we provide the curated information in the form of a neo4j (neo4j.com) graph database.
