A curated database reveals trends in single-cell transcriptomics
================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q103034964]  

# Highlights

To facilitate discovery with published single-cell transcriptomics data, we have assembled a near exhaustive, manually curated database of single-cell transcriptomics studies with key information: descriptions of the type of data and technologies used, along with descriptors of the biological systems studied.

We focus on a missing resource, namely a database of single-cell transcriptomics studies generating data and results, rather than primary data.

the number of cell types or clusters identified in each study is recorded under Number of reported cell types or clusters.
This is most commonly based on de novo clustering, but in some cases, it is based on the number of distinct presorted cell types. 

The database can be accessed via a graphical user interface (GUI) using Google Sheets at http://www.nxn.se/single- cell-studies/gui.

--> Does not use ontologies :( 

Every day a snapshot of the database is saved (in TSV
format) using Google Cloud Functions, and all these snap- shots are available in a public Google Storage bucket at gs://single-cell-studies

Many tissues have been investigated by single-cell transcriptomics methods, but the brain is the most popular with 171 associated citations out of 1033 (Table 1)

We found that analysis of other aspects of the studies described in the papers, namely attributes such as type of protocol, number of cells or the number of clusters identified, revealed interesting trends in the field.
