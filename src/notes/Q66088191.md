# Highlights

ojects. The WikiCite initiative is unique in bringing together the Wikidata, linked data, and
library community together to collaborate on the future of open bibliographic data.

WikiCite 2018 was a 3-day conference, which included formal presentations, group discussion
and a hack day/do-a-thon. The conference took place in Berkeley, California, USA on
November 27-29, 2018.

The day started with an  opening review by Dario Taraborelli, who was then Head of Research at the Wikimedia Foundation, and culminated with a keynote by Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director Katherine Maher.

s. Perceived risks in this scenario are that
tightly coupling Wikipedia with Wikidata has the potential to irritate or disrupt both the
Wikipedia and Wikidata user communities

The three scenarios covered in the Summit represent three different potential paths for the
WikiCite effort

News from the movement

  Scholia is a tool to explore and visualize scholarly and
bibliographic information in Wikidata.

One of the most important developments, arising in parallel with the WikiCite effort, is the
“rise of Wikidata” as an emerging source of Linked Open Data for libraries and library
organizations

In April 2019, the Association of Research Libraries issued a White Paper on Wikidata:
Opportunities and Recommendations

"I think while this event was great, to duplicate it would be the wrong approach – each
event should evolve to reflect the latest state of things as the project itself moves forward."

Total Cost of WikiCite 2018 $90,336.83
--> quite some money
