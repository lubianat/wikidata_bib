# Highlights
criticisms represent long-standing conflicts over the role of hypothesis testing in science
and not just a dispute about the amount of data used. 

Here, we show that an iterative account of scientific methods developed by historians and
philosophers of science can help make sense of data-intensive scientific practices and suggest more effective ways to evaluate this research.

Consequently, in some areas of science (e.g., astronomy), there can be particularly sharp distinctions between historical and current data-intensive
approaches, whereas in other areas of science (e.g., natural history), there are fewer differences

data-intensive research has been criticized for being atheoretical, being nothing more than a “fishing expedition,”
having a high probability of leading to nonsense results

scholars argue that focusing primarily on a linear, hypothesis-driven account of science impoverishes the scientific enterprise

hypothesis-driven approaches are particularly helpful for choosing between alternative mechanisms that could explain
an observed phenomenon (e.g., through a controlled experiment), but they are much less helpful for mapping out new
areas of inquiry (e.g., the sequence of the human genome),

identifying important relationships among many different variables, or studying complex systems

Most scientists did not favor the use of hypotheses during the eighteenth century, but this perspective changed
dramatically over the next 100 years (Laudan 1981).

Many concerns about data-intensive research can be addressed by defining scientific practice more broadly
(figure 3)

the fundamental goal of science is to address gaps or challenges facing our current state of knowledge

--> This is key 

with the advent of high-throughput technologies, other approaches that are more inductive also play
a fruitful role in scientific research 

Broad hypotheses or background assumptions may still provide guidance about what sorts of questions or
exploratory inquiries are likely to be most fruitful, but these are not the sorts of specific hypotheses envisioned by most
hypothesis-driven accounts of scientific method 


In many cases, this web of activities generates the sorts of tightly constrained contexts
in which specific hypotheses can be fruitfully tested, but this may be just one component of a much broader scientific
context. 

In fact, the methodological iteration between different approaches results in a process of epistemic iteration
by which our knowledge is gradually altered and improved, as is depicted by the two-way arrows in figure 3 that 
highlight the links among knowledge, motivation, and the multiple approaches employed by scientists.

--> This figure 3 is super nice

Despite the efforts of some commentators to reconstruct Darwin’s research as primarily hypothesis-driven,
he spent more than two decades performing exploratory work in an effort to identify the patterns that he
later explained in The Origin of Species. 

Darwin’s use of both inductive and deductive methods also followed Whewell’s methodological recommendations. 
In contrast with more recent accounts of hypothesis-driven science, Whewell insisted that scientists should move through
a very gradual inductive process to arrive at successively more general causal laws


First, funding agencies (and reviewers) should evaluate the quality of proposed research
not based on a uniform requirement that it states a specific hypothesis but based on the importance of the knowledge
gaps that it identifies and the appropriateness of the methods proposed for addressing those gaps

Therefore, rather than expecting researchers to shoehorn proposals into a misleading, 
linear research format, reviewers should be open to proposals that describe a more realistic, 
iterative research trajectory

Table 1. Recommendations for promoting iterative data-intensive science.

--> This table is neat. It does not move away from current publishing schemas, though. 

An interdisciplinary team was created (sensu Cheruvelil et al. 2014)


Of course, this does not mean that “anything goes”; rather, it
facilitates more careful thought about how to fund, publish,
and teach the right combinations of methods that will enable
the scientific community to tackle the big issues confronting
society today.
