# Highlights

Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics techniques have opened the door to the study of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) at the single-cell level. Here, we studied the GRNs controlling the emergence of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from mouse embryonic endothelium using a combination of single-cell transcriptome assays. We found that a heptad of transcription factors (Runx1, Gata2, Tal1, Fli1, Lyl1, Erg and Lmo2) is specifically co-expressed in an intermediate population expressing both endothelial and hematopoietic markers.

This work shows that GRN analysis based on single-cell transcriptomics data can highlight biological aspects that are missed by classical bulk methods, emphasizing the power of single-cell approaches in the understanding of complex developmental transitions.
