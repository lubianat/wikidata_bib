# Highlights

IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® is the global reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. By its creation in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Université de Montpellier and CNRS), IMGT® marked the advent of immunoinformatics, which emerged at the interface between immunogenetics and bioinformatics.

IMGT® is specialized in the immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility (MH), and proteins of the IgSF and MhSF superfamilies


The human TRβ locus (TRB) consists of a cluster of TRBV genes located upstream (in 5′) of two D-J-C clusters

A gene family, the protease serine (PRSS) trypsinogen genes (TRY), is situated among the TRBV genes. 

The IMGT 5′ borne of the TRB locus is the monooxygenase dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-like 2 (MOXD2) gene and the IMGT 3′ borne of the locus is the ephrin type-b receptor 6 (EPHB6) gene. These two genes were defined as IMGT borne of the TRB locus because they correspond to genes (other than IG or TR) located, respectively, in the 5′ and 3′ end of the locus and they are conserved among species (http://imgt.org/IMGTindex/IMGTborne.php).

2.1. Annotation of the TRB Locus

Each locus sequence was localized on the corresponding chromosome, when available, or on the scaffolds and subsequently extracted from NCBI assembly (17) 

Protein display of the TRBC genes in human (Homsap), rhesus monkey (Macmul), dog (Canlupfam), cat (Felcat), ferret (Musputfur), rabbit (Orycun), sheep (Oviari), and pig (Susscr).
