# Highlights


These results define both body-wide and tissue-specific (heart, liver, lung, kidney, and lymph nodes) damage wrought by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, evident as a function of varying viral load (high vs. low) during the course of infection and specific, transcriptional dysregulation in splicing isoforms, T cell receptor expression, and cellular expression states. 

T cell receptor expressed motifs (TCEMs) alterations. We also used a spatial  protein  and  transcript  mapping  platform  (GeoMx)  to  delineate  the  cartography  of  the  infection  in  these  tissues  and  to  discover  disruptions  of  cell-to-cell  interactions

GeoMx   Cancer   Transcriptome Atlas Panel (CTA, 1811 targets), supplemented with 23 human genes associated with lung biology and two ORFs from the SARS-CoV-2 genome

For each ROI, count estimates of 15 distinct cell types were imputed based on gene expression profiles  from  the  Human  Cell  Atlas  (HCA)  adult  lung  dataset,  including  a  neutrophil  profile  derived  from  snRNA-seq  of  lung  tumors  (see  Methods).  Consistent  with  other  studies10,11,  we  observed  that  COVID-19  was  associated  with  an  increase  in  tissue  infiltrating  immune  cells,  including T cells, NK cells, monocytes, and macrophages (Figure 2a).

we  assembled  CDR3  sequences  from  the  patient-specific  RNA-Seq  data and derived a set of T Cell Expressed Motifs (TCEMs); TCEMs are amino acid sequences that  can  be  recognized  as  an  antigen  by  a  T  Cell  when  presented  by  an  MHC.  We  mapped  these  TCEMs  to  the  SARS-CoV-2  reference  genome,  to  quantify  the  likely  response  of  the  T  cells  to  the  virus
