# Highlights

This review will focus upon recent insights and advances in the biology of pancreatic ductal cells.

A) Centroacinar cells are terminal end duct cells that interface with acini 

Second, we will address acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM), which is an important component of pancreatitis and neoplastic transformation. 

Ductal cells express markers such as cytokeratin 19 (K19), cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor, carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), and DBA lectin and transcriptional factors such as HNF1β, HNF6, and SOX9

Gu et al. showed that pancreatic ducts emerge from Pdx1-expressing cells that separate from the endocrine and exocrine lineages between E9.5 and E11.5 (41)

--> Totally mixes mice and human

The Hnf6 transcription factor appears to be important in pancreatic ductal development. Mice lacking the gene (Hnf6–/– mice) develop cysts in interlobular and intralobular pancreatic ducts but not in intercalated pancreatic ducts

The most common subtype of human pancreatic malignancy is PDAC. It has been established that PDAC is preceded by the evolution of precursor lesions, PanIN 1A/B, 2, and 3 (83, 84), and, under certain conditions, ADM might be critical for the development of PanIN lesions (70, 71)
