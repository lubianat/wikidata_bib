# Highlights

• Olfactory sensory neurons harbor unique, odorant receptor-specific transcriptomes
• Receptor engagement by environmental odors drives transcriptional variation


Here, we show that each of the ∼1,000 olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) subtypes in the mouse harbors a distinct transcriptome whose content is precisely determined by interactions between its odorant receptor and the environment.

The sensory periphery therefore separates salient signals from predictable background via a transcriptional rheostat whose moment-to-moment state reflects the past and constrains the future; these findings suggest a general model in which structured transcriptional variation within a cell type reflects individual experience.

However, it is not clear how sensory neurons adapt at the longer timescales over which animals traverse different environments—and therefore encounter different background stimuli—as is common during a typical circadian cycle.

There are ∼1,000 different olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) subtypes in the mouse, each of which can be identified across individuals based upon its expression of a single odorant receptor (OR) (Monahan and Lomvardas, 2015)

For example, OSN responses to odors (as assessed by functional imaging of OSN axons in the olfactory bulb, the first waystation for odor information in the brain) appear similar in individual mice tested at different times, across different mice, and in mice before and after training to associate a test odorant with a reward.

To address these questions we characterized, via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), transcriptional variation across the extraordinarily large array of identifiable OSN subtype

To assess relationships between transcription and function in the peripheral olfactory system we performed scRNA-seq on ∼770,000 mature mouse OSNs (Table S1). Our initial analysis focused on ∼40,000 mature OSNs derived from adult mice housed in a typical home cage environment; collectively, these OSNs expressed more than 1,000 ORs, with nearly every mature neuron expressing only one OR (Figures 1A and S1A–S1D)

For example, the transcriptomes of OSNs expressing Olfr727 were self-similar and distinct from OSNs expressing Olfr728 and Olfr729 (Figure 1D). The transcriptomes of all OR-identified OSN subtypes were distinguishable, regardless of how transcriptome distances were computed or the frequency with which each OR was expressed (Figures 1D and S1F–S1I).

The unexpectedly close relationship between OR expression and OSN transcriptomes could result from shared regulatory mechanisms, or from each OR determining its associated transcriptome


Each OSN can also be categorized by the expression of CD36, the specific class of its expressed OR (class I versus class II), or the dorsal or ventral location of its associated glomeruli in the olfactory bulb

ES scores for OSNs derived from mice housed in the home cage varied continuously across OSN subtypes; however, OSN subtype-specific ES scores were remarkably consistent across mice and enabled accurate predictions of OR identity 


To test whether activation scores also capture differences in binding affinities between different ligands for the same receptor, we took advantage of 2-hydroxyacetophenone (2-HA), which, relative to acetophenone, binds more strongly to the M72 receptor (Arneodo et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2012). Act-seq revealed that 2-HA indeed elicits higher activation scores than acetophenone in OSNs expressing M72 (Figure 5H). Conversely, activation scores for OSNs expressing Olfr923, a high-affinity acetophenone receptor, were higher for acetophenone than 2-HA (Hu et al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2015). Furthermore, 2-HA, acetophenone, and two related odors each elicited a broad range of

Taken together, these results demonstrate that odor-evoked activation is not determined solely by the affinities of odors for their receptors, but rather is flexibly tuned in each OSN by functional genes, which adapt OSNs in an OR-specific manner to the specific contents of each odor environment.

Our data demonstrate that the OR repertoire is densely activated by airflow and odors in our environments, suggesting that every OSN must contend with some degree of chronic activation.  

Taken together, our findings—enabled by the ability to query gene expression and activity in ∼1,000 different OSN subtypes across experiments—are consistent with a general model in which neurons systematically modulate their transcriptomes to continuously adapt to their inputs.
