# Highlights

Identification and analysis of host–pathogen interactions (HPI) is essential to study infec-tious diseases. However, HPI data are sparse in existing molecular interaction databases,especially for agricultural host–pathogen systems. Therefore, resources that annotate, pre-dict and display the HPI that underpin infectious diseases are critical for developing novelintervention strategies. HPIDB 2.0 (http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/hpi/main.html) is a re-source for HPI data, and contains 45, 238 manually curated entries in the current release

Notably, HPIDB 2.0 now pro-vides targeted biocuration of molecular interaction data. As a member of the InternationalMolecular Exchange consortium, annotations provided by HPIDB 2.0 curators meet com-munity standards to provide detailed contextual experimental information and facilitatedata sharing


All HPIDB 2.0 dataare updated regularly, are publically available for direct download, and are disseminatedto other molecular interaction resourc

. A recent interactome study of Porcine Reproductiveand Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) NSP2, the larg-est replication protein in PRRSV, with its host cellular pro-teins enabled gaining functional insights into the roles ofNSP2 in the replication and pathogenesis of PRRSV andidentified novel cellular target proteins regulating the virusreplication (5).

. To provide a unified query interface for HPI infor-mation, HPIDB 2.0 includes both data and interface up-dates.  Modifications  include  biocuration  of  HPI  fromliterature  compliant  with  community  standards  that  canserve as gold standard for HPI prediction algorithms. 

. Therefore, we encour-age the scientific community to suggest relevant articles forcuration by HPIDB 2.0 and work closely with HPI curators

As of February 2016, HPIDB 2.0 added over 2,610 mo-lecular interactions from literature, of which 71% are HPIswhile  the  remaining  are  incidental  intra-species  inter-actions described in the same literature.

Visualization of BVDV–bovine interaction network in HPIDB 2.0. The represented network is obtained by selecting ‘Network Visualization’ inthe result page obtained from a taxon search of HPIDB 2.0 data for BVDV strain NADL.

In addition, HPIDB2.0 results now include GO functional information for theinteracting pair where available.

All interaction information is returned as a table which canbe downloaded as a MITAB file. The returned results alsocontain hyperlinks for each host and pathogen protein in-formation and links to available GO information as a ‘GOsummary’    file    that    can    directly    be    uploaded    toGOSlimViewer at AgBase (34) 

HPIDB 2.0 is available at http://www.agbase.msstate.edu/hpi/main.html.


HPIDB 2.0 curatedmolecular  interaction  data  is  freely  available  without  re-striction form HPIDB 2.0 or PSICQUIC.
