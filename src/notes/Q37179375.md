# Highlights
We implemented an LBD system based on the A-B-C model that can be configured to use different relations between terms and used it to carry out experiments comparing a range of different types of relations. For all our experiments, we use UMLS22 Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) as terms (as identified by MetaMap), although the system is not limited to these and can work with terms directly (see discussion in Section “Focus on Scale” below).

relation: The relation used to describe the relationship between terms – titi and tjtj may be related under one relation, but not another.

weight: The weight, rather than frequency, assigned to each relationship (which will yield a resulting weight for each hidden connection, allowing a ranking to be constructed).

size: The size of the collection from which the matrix is built—this can be restricted to a particular time interval or possibly even particular category of abstracts.

The UMLS Semantic Network consists of 133 semantic types, a type of subject category, and each CUI is assigned a type. Many of these types are unhelpful for knowledge discovery (e.g., geographic area or language). Seventy semantic types (which can be viewed at Online Supplementary Appendix A) were manually identified as not being useful, leading to the removal of a further 121,284 CUIs.
