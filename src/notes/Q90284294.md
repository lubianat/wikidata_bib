# Highlights

The turnover of the intestinal epithelium is driven by multipotent LGR5+ crypt-base columnar cells (CBCs) located at the bottom of crypt zon

Thus, a second population of quiescent ‘+4’ cells, or reserve stem cells (RSCs), has previously been proposed to regenerate the damaged intestine4–7
n addition, progenitors of absorptive enterocytes10,secretory cells11–15 and slow cycling LGR5+ cells16 have been shown to contribute to regeneration whereas the transcriptional regulator YAP1, which is important for intestinal regeneration, was suggested to induce a pro-survival phenotype in LGR5+ cells17

revSCs are marked by high clusterin expression and are extremely rare under homoeostatic conditions, yet give rise—in a temporal hierarchy—to all the major cell types of the intestine, including LGR5+ CBCs

o define the mechanisms that underlie regeneration, we tran-scriptionally profiled single cells from small intestinal epithelia three days after exposure to 12 Gy of whole-body irradiation (Fig. 1a).

CLU+  cells are rare but multipotent under homoeostasis.

Collectively, our results identify revSCs as a slow-cycling cell type that arises in damaged intestines following YAP1-dependent signal-ling to reconstitute LGR5+ CBCs and regenerate the intestine (Fig. 4e). Damage-induced expansion of revSCs—rather than a resident regen-erative stem cell or general cell plasticity—may therefore be a key mechanism that underlies tissue repair in response to injury.
