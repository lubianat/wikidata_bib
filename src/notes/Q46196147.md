# Highlights

Geneticists are up in arms over the introduction of a subscription fee for access to the protein databases owned and maintained by Incyte Genomics, a private company based in Palo Alto, California.

The databases, which contain information about protein structure and function in important model organisms studied by biologists, had been free to academics. But Incyte last month introduced an annual access charge of $2,000 per laboratory — a move that has already prompted an effort to secure more funding for public databases.



Incyte's database collection, known as the Proteome BioKnowledge Library, covers model organisms such as yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and also features some mammalian and microbial databases.

Peer Bork (left) and Michael Cherry would like to see more money for public protein databases.

 “My plea to researchers is to take database curation into your own hands,” he says. “Everyone has to pitch in if they are to be freely available.”
