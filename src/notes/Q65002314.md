# Highlights

We explore in this paper an automated method for assessing the consistency of biological assertions, to assist biocurators, which we call BARC, Biocuration tool for Assessment of Relation Consistency.

However, biological databases such as GenBank or UniProt contain hundreds of millions of uncurated nucleic acid and protein sequence records [7], which suffer from a large range of data quality issues including errors, discrepancies, redundancies, ambiguities, and incompleteness [8, 9].

Biocuration can be defined as the transformation of biological data into an organized form 


In the context of biocuration, the information retrieval task that consists of finding relevant articles for the curation of a biological database is called triage [76â€“80]. Triage can be seen as a semi-automated method for assessing biological statements

Also, in the biomedical context, Light et al. [81] used a handcrafted list of cues to identify speculative sentences in MEDLINE abstract by looking for specific keywords which imply speculative content. However, it is unclear how this method generalizes to relations that are mentioned in both speculative and non-speculative sentences
