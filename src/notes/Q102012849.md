# Highlights

As transparency and provenance are
essential for researchers, in this paper, we introduce ScholarLensViz, a
visualization component for scholarly user profiles displaying a scholarâ€™s
research competences including the provenance

In most applications, scholars are permitted to inspect these collected user preferences but do not know where the information comes from.
However, the justification of entries is an important issue in scholarly profiles.
Users need explanations why a certain preference is presented.

Full semantic approaches are VIVO [5] and Scholia [6]. While VIVO provides a framework, an ontology and a graphical user interface for representing and visualizing scholars and their research context
within an organization, Scholia aims at visualizing scientific bibliographic information through Wikidata

The arc of the pie slices denotes the competence rank, and the color represents the category obtained from
the Computer Science Ontology (CSO) [7] by matching the competence entries
(which are presented as DBpedia entities) with CSO labels
