# Highlights

. To meet these growing needs, we developed ChlamBase, a model organism database for Chlamydia that is built upon the WikiGenomes application framework, and Wikidata, a community-curated database.

ChlamBase is freely and publicly available at chlambase.org.

This module delegates multiple alignments to the external web service MUSCLE (18) and subsequently displays the results in the JavaScript widget MSAViewer for interactive navigation of aligned sequences (19).

Annotation submission forms for ChlamBase. The GO form prompts the user to submit information for (A) GO term, typeahead enabled and the method used for determination (i.e. inferred from experiment and inferred from sequence orthology)

We view ChlamBase as a thin web interface that serves as a bidirectional translation layer between Wikidata and expert Chlamydia researchers. We believe that ChlamBase (and other similar applications) will play key roles in enabling domain experts to contribute structured knowledge and in storing that knowledge in a fully open community resource.
