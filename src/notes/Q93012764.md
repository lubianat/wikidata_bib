# Highlights

This analysis revealed a 
previously unappreciated level of cellular heterogeneity within the BM niche, identified novel 
cellular subsets, and resolved cellular sources of pro-hematopoietic growth factors, chemokines, 
and membrane-bound ligands. U


These findings refine our understanding of the cellular architecture of the BM niche,
maintained in a specialized BM microenvironment composed of leptin 
receptor positive (LepR+) mesenchymal stromal cells and vascular endothelial cell

Our data is available for further exploration of cellular heterogeneity (http://aifantislab.com/
niche). As the goal of our study was to broadly define BM niche architecture, we focused on 
the largest subpopulations.

Arterial-associated genes 
were expressed in cluster V1 (Ly6ahigh; orange) and sinusoidal signature were specific to 
cluster V2 (Stab2high; blue)
 
A growing body of evidence proposes a departure from the traditional hierarchical model of 
hematopoiesis, suggesting instead a fluidity in the ability of each HSC to differentiate 
towards distinct lineages48. It is tempting to hypothesize that such plasticity is dictated by 
unique interactions between HSCs and the components of the microenvironment
