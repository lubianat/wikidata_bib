# Highlights
Fibro/Adipogenic Progenitors (FAPs) are muscle-interstitial progenitors mediating pro-myogenic signals that are critical for
muscle homeostasis and regeneration.

s. Here, by combining pharmacological screening, high-dimensional mass cytometry and in
silico network modeling with the integration of single-cell/bulk RNA sequencing data, we highlighted the canonical WNT/
GSK/β-catenin signaling as a crucial pathway modulating FAP adipogenesis triggered by insulin signaling

. Combining, publicly available single-cell RNAseq datasets, we characterize FAPs as the main source of
WNT ligands inferring their potential in mediating autocrine/paracrine responses in the muscle nich

Fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) are
interstitial progenitors of mesenchymal origin [21] that
contribute to muscle homeostasis [17] and regeneration by
transiently supporting the activation and differentiation of
muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) [7, 13, 16, 17, 22]

For single-cell profiling via CyTOF2, amplified FAPs, from
three independent mice, were maintained in FAP-GM or
induced to differentiate into adipocytes by incubating cells


TA muscles were dissected and embedded in optimal cutting temperature medium and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
for 10 s. 

LY2090314 promotes MuSC self-renewal while
boosting the ability of FAPs to promote MuSCs
myogenesis in an ex vivo co-culture system
