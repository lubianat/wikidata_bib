# Highlights

All of this is made even harder, as, at this point, there is not even a clear definition of a cell type. The Cell Ontology (CO) is a good step towards standardizing cell type definitions, but it is only restricted to animal cells [22]. Despite this, we believe that AFP researchers and curators of the GO need to start preparing for a possible transition to this more specialized AFP phase. (...)  A similar approach has been applied in predicting novel cell types from gene expression data using Cell Ontology [22] embeddings [47]

Together, we show that AFP is still a vibrant research area that can benefit from continuing advances in machine learning with which AFP in the 2020s can again take a large step forward reinforcing the power of computational biology.

The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) challenges provide an objective evaluation of modern AFP algorithms on a set of proteins with newly-acquired GO annotations [10,11,12]. 

To make protein representation tissue-specific, Zitnik and Leskovec adapted the node2vec method to extract tissue-specific protein embeddings from tissue-specific Protein-Protein Interaction (PP) networks which were then fed to a linear classifier to predict function [23]. It would be interesting to extend this approach to co-expression networks, which are probably a lot more variable

Unfortunately, predicting cell-type-specific and/or condition-specific function is a lot harder, as the number of possible outcomes increases in a combinatorial fashion. The number of GO terms is already very large, so creating a separate target variable for each combination of GO term, cell-type and condition would be intractable
