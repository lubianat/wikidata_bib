# Highlights
We propose four graph-based, neural network methods to perform open and closed LBD. We compared our methods with those used by the state-of-the-art LION LBD system on the same evaluations to replicate recently published findings in cancer biology. 

LBD has already been used to identify new connections between biomedical entities and new candidate genes and treatments for illnesses [6] and to propose treatments for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and Multiple Sclerosis [11, 12]. It has seen use in drug development and repurposing [13, 14] as well as predicting adverse drug reactions [15, 16]. It has also been used to propose new potential cancer treatments [17] and identify promising research collaborations [18].

The recently-released LION LBD system [19] reports state-of-the-art results in LBD. It uses PubTator [20] for annotating PubMed scientific articles with concepts such as chemicals, genes/proteins, mutations, diseases and species; as well as sentence-level annotation of cancer hallmarks that describe fundamental cancer processes and behaviour [21]. It uses co-occurrence metrics to rank relations between concepts and performs both open and closed discovery.
