# Highlights

Biomedical ontologies provide essential domain
knowledge to drive data integration, information
retrieval, data annotation, natural-language processing and decision support. BioPortal (http://
bioportal.bioontology.org) is an open repository
of biomedical ontologies that provides access via
Web services and Web browsers to ontologies
developed in OWL, RDF, OBO format and Prote´ ge´
frames.

--> Web site is fully functional and very good.

. BioPortal also enables
integrated search of biomedical data resources
such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO),
ClinicalTrials.gov, and ArrayExpress, through the
annotation and indexing of these resources with
ontologies in BioPortal.

Most researchers in biomedicine, however, are interested in biomedical data and not the ontologies per se.
Indeed, ontologies provide the means for users to interpret
and integrate the data. 

In March 2008, the repository included 72 ontologies (300 000 total classes) and has
almost doubled in the last year to 134 ontologies (680 000
total classes)

--> I wonder how many there are as of today

Notes
Users can add notes to all ontology classes in BioPortal,
discussing the rationale for modeling decisions, pointing
out problems with definitions and requesting changes
from ontology authors.

--> Cool, just like in Wikidata.


The Open Biomedical Resources (OBR) component
automatically indexes the metadata for important biomedical data sets available online (e.g. entries in GEO,
ArrayExpress, ClinicalTrials.gov), and links the underlying data sets to the terms in the ontologies in BioPortal
and UMLS. The annotation of these resources takes
advantage of the semantic relationships in the ontology,
including subsumption relationships among ontology
terms and mappings among ontologie

--> Nice.

Currently, the Marine Metadata Interoperability
Project (http://marinemetadata.org/aboutmmi) and
National Cancer Institute (http://bioportal.nci.nih.gov/
ncbo/faces/index.xhtml) are using BioPortal as their
ontology repository.
