# Highlights
We developed a scalable approach to sequence and quantify RNA molecules in isolated neuronal nuclei from a postmortem brain, generating
3227 sets of single-neuron data from six distinct regions of the cerebral cortex. Using an iterative
clustering and classification approach, we identified 16 neuronal subtypes that were further
annotated on the basis of known markers and cortical cytoarchitecture

ortical regional heterogeneity within subtypes was also observed, as evident by a layer 3 population (In4) that showed a specific absence of RELN/SST expression in BA17 (Fig. 2C and fig. S11, B and D). As such, our data distinguished inhibitory neuron subtypes having heterogeneous distributions within the neocortex


Neuronal subtypes reveal heterogeneity
among BAs. (A) Multidimensional plot showing pro-
jection neuron subtypes distributed according to
their predicted cortical layer (L) identity. Layer 4 Ex2
and Ex3 subtypes are indicated. (B) Clusters shown
in (A) colored by BA and with BA41/42 and BA17 sub-
populations of Ex3 indicated
