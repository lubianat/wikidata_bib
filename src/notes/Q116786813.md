# Highlights

 Here, we constructed a comprehensive and updatable database of receptor-ligand pairs and complemented it with single-cell transcriptomics of immune cells and sensory neurons in three distinct inflammatory pain conditions, to generate injury-specific neuroimmune interactomes. We identified cell-type-specific neuroimmune axes that are common, as well as unique, to different injury types

 This approach predicted a
repertoire of known as well as novel neuroimmune interactions for each pain condition. Interestingly, each
inflammatory pain model exhibited a significantly different immune cell state signature with a unique
repertoire of potential receptor-ligand interactions between immune cells and sensory neurons. Immunederived thrombospondin-1

To identify the transcriptional expression of receptors on DRG neurons complementary to ligands produced
by the immune cells, we utilized a previously published dataset of single-nuc seq of mouse DRG neurons,
from our lab 5
. This dataset consists of nine subsets of sensory neurons, including peptidergic, nonpeptidergic nociceptors, cLTMR, and Nefh+ neurons (Supp Fig 3A)

Ifngr2, which encodes the receptor for the type 1 cytokine IFN, was enriched in cLTMR neurons,
suggesting that cLTMRs preferentially respond to IFN-producing cells such as CD8 T cells and NK cells
(Fig 2B)

First, we defined that set of ligands, receptors, enzymes, and ion channels to consider in the interactome.
To construct the set of ligands and receptors, we used the CellPhoneDB interactome as a reference

Given INDRA’s ability to standardize and align representations of interactions from structured sources and text mining, the interactome is tied directly to the scientific literature.

In addition to these known pathways, the analysis also predicted novel neuroimmune axes in inflammatory
pain, such as Spp1-S1pr1, Spp1-Cd44, Thbs1-CD47, Thbs1-Lrp1, and Ccl18-Ackr1 (Fig 3F).
