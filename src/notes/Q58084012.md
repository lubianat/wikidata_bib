# Highlights

Spanish neuroscientist Santiago Ramón y Cajal created a ‘portrait gallery’ of neurons.

(...)
The authors identified more than 100 different cell types, including 61 types of inhibitory neuron and 56 types of excitatory neuron. They found that most cell types were present in both cortical areas — with the exception of excitatory neurons

Functional specialization of cortical areas might rely not only on differences in microcircuits and connectivity patterns, but also on the use of different cell types to process information.

Economo et al. engineered each subpopulation of neurons to express the protein channelrhodopsin — a light-sensitive ion channel. This enables neuronal activity to be precisely controlled using light (a method known as optogenetics), and so allowed the authors to dissect the roles of the upper and the lower layer-5 neurons in different types of motor function. These markers could be used to design more optogenetic experiments that target specific neuronal populations; to investigate whether ‘area-specific’ cell types can be found in other cortical regions;

--> The genetic engineering facet seems like a fertile ground for dealing with definitions
