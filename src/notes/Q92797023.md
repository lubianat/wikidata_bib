# Highlights

ProMyelocyticLeukemia (PML) protein can polymerize into a mega-Dalton nuclear assembly
of 0.1–2 μm in diameter.

. In addition, single cell RNA sequencing analysis shows that B1 oligomer-
ization is an important regulator in PML-RARα-driven transactivation.

he presence of
SUMO moiety had signiﬁcantly enhanced the expression and
folding of PML 1–256 that contained the RING, B1, B2, and a 20-
residue CC. This allowed the subsequent puriﬁcations involving
several chromatography steps (Fig. 1b).
