# Highlights

Meta-analysis of human, non-human primate, and mouse single-cell RNA-seq datasets for putative SARS-CoV-2 targets

Type II pneumocytes, nasal secretory cells, and absorptive enterocytes are ACE2+TMPRSS2+

A tissue-level basis for understanding SARS-CoV tropism was proposed based on ACE2 histological staining and expression in human epithelia of the lung and small intestine (Hamming et al., 2004
, Harmer et al., 2002
, Jonsdottir and Dijkman, 2016
). However, unlike the specific expression of CDHR3 (the rhinovirus-C receptor), which is resolved to ciliated epithelial cells of the upper airway (Griggs et al., 2017
), the specific cell subsets within each tissue that express ACE2 remain unknown. Identifying the cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2+) and those at greatest risk of direct infection (ACE2+TMPRSS2+) is critical for understanding and modulating host defense mechanisms and viral pathogenesis.


Here, using published and unpublished datasets (all from non-SARS-CoV-2-infected samples), we analyze human, NHP, and mouse tissues that have been clinically identified to harbor virus in patients exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms.


To investigate which cells within human and NHP tissues represent likely SARS-CoV-2 targets, we analyzed new and existing scRNA-seq datasets to assess which cell types express ACE2, alone or with TMPRSS2. In a previously unpublished dataset consisting of NHP (Macaca mulatta) lung tissue collected after necropsy of healthy adult animals and analyzed by using Seq-Well v1 (Gierahn et al., 2017
), we recovered at least 17 distinct major cell types, including various lymphoid, myeloid, and stromal populations (Figures 1A–1C; Table S1; STAR Methods). ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were primarily expressed in epithelial cells, with 6.7% of type II pneumocytes expressing ACE2 and 3.8% co-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Figures 1B and 1C).

Of note, we also observed TRIM28 co-expressed with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 among type II pneumocytes in this dataset (FDR-adjusted p = 2.34E−9)

. While conducting experiments to directly test the hypothesis that ACE2 is an ISG, we noted in our own gene lists used for scoring from Ordovas-Montanes et al., 2018
and in a supplementary extended table available from Giovannini-Chami et al., 2012
that ACE2 was in upregulated gene lists after exposure to Type I IFN.


Our study highlights the power of scRNA-seq datasets, both existing and novel, to derive hypotheses relevant to human disease that might differ from paradigms established by using cell lines. Further work will be critical to determine how SARS-CoV-2 influences temporal dynamics of host responses at single-cell resolution and which host factors might affect this (Kazer et al., 2020
). Given the unappreciated complexities of host-pathogen interactions between humans and SARS-CoV-2, the best measures to combat this pandemic continue to be surveillance and avoidance—especially given that a deep understanding of the full spectrum of resistance and tolerance mechanisms will require the concerted efforts of scientists around the globe (Amanat et al., 2020
, Chu et al., 2020
, Hadfield et al., 2018
). Here, we seek to share our initial findings and data so that other groups might build on this discovery of ACE2 as an ISG and further consider the careful balance between tissue tolerance and viral infection needed at the human airway epithelium.
