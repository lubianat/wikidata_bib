# Highlights

We consolidated open access databases and manually curated missing information from
the literature published between 1970 and March 2020. The result is the database CyanoMetDB, which
includes more than 2000 entries based on more than 750 literature references. This effort has more than
doubled the total number of entries with complete literature metadata and structural composition
(SMILES codes) compared to publicly available databases to this date

CyanoMetDB is a flat-file database (i.e., a single table) c
