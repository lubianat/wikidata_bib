# Highlights

These samples (e.g.,
blood, tumor, or brain tissues) are often mixtures of different cell types. The importance of accounting for cell composition in high-throughput data analyses has been wellrecognized 

--> "often" could be changed for "always"

For RF deconvolution, selecting an appropriate number
of cell types is a difficult question. We provide more discussion toward the selection of cell type numbers in the
“Discussions” section. Here we use our DNA methylation
simulation study to explore the impact of having 6 cell
types (CD4T, CD8T, Gran, Mono, NK, B cells) versus 4
cell types (CD4T+CD8T+NK, Gran, Mono, B cells) on
RF deconvolution and the proposed method. As expected,
increasing number of cell types leads to lower correlations of estimated proportions versus true proportions
even after applying TOAST

We present TOAST, a feature selection method for
reference-free deconvolution to estimate cellular composition from high-throughput data of complex samples.
We design an iterative algorithm, based on cross-cell
type differential analysis
