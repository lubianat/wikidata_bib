# Highlights

Here we used single-cell transcriptomics to investigate intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity in 25 medulloblastomas spanning all molecular subgroups. WNT, SHH and Group 3 tumours comprised subgroup-specific undifferentiated and differentiated neuronal-like malignant populations, whereas Group 4 tumours consisted exclusively of differentiated neuronal-like neoplastic cells. 


We find that WNT, SHH and Group 3 tumours exhibit subgroup-specific cellular trajectories that consist of malignant undifferentiated and differentiated neuronal-like populations, whereas Group 4 tumours recapitulate more differentiated populations of known lineage

<!-- Nice figure, showcases the heterogeneity quite nicely. -->

These findings will enable future studies to assess translational opportunities and to evaluate the impact of therapeutic approaches on the spectrum of cellular states that drive MB.
