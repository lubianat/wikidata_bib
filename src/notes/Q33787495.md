# Highlights


 In this work,we present the results that we obtained in the BioCreative Interactive Track (IAT), using asemiautomatic approach for improving biocuration of miRNAs related to diseases. Ourprocedures will be useful to complement databases that contain this type of information.We adapted the OntoGene text mining pipeline and the ODIN curation system in a full-text corpus of scientific publications concerning one specific respiratory disease

  A significant advantage of our semiautomatic pipeline isthat it can be applied to obtain the miRNAs of all the respiratory diseases and offers thepossibility to be used for other illnesses.

At this time, there are about 324 219 known interactionsbetweenmiRNAsandtheirtargetgenesfor2619miRNAs,obtained from a total of 4264 articles about different organsand human diseases in the mirTarBase v6.0  

In  this  article,  we  describe  the  results  of a  pilotproject that focused on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

We used RapidMiner, a framework for data mining analysis(https://rapidminer.com/)  to  obtain  the  terms  frequentlyused in articles and that are important to consider in the bio-curation.

ODIN interface. At the left side there is the article tagged and at the right side all the terms that appeared at the dictionary.

--> Simple but interesting interface

When  compared  with  the  standard  approach  based  onmanualbiocuration,thesemiautomatedapproachdescribed  in  this  article  allows  us  to  save  a  considerableamount of time.
