# Highlights

In this work, we present the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a biomedical KG connecting millions of concepts via semantically meaningful relationships. SPOKE contains 27 million nodes of 21 different types and 53 million edges of 55 types downloaded from 41 database


SPOKE enables the integration of seemingly disparate information to support precision medicine efforts.

 The API is documented more fully at https://spoke.rbvi.ucsf.edu/swagger/. The metagraph call returns a cytoscape.js (Franz et al., 2016) formatted JSON file that reflects the current SPOKE metagraph. The SPOKE call for getting information about nodes is the full-text search call search. The search call takes two arguments: a node type and a query term. This call uses the Neo4j full-text capability to quickly return a set of matching nodes of the indicated type that match that query, where the query is a lucene-formatted (Białecki et al., 2012) query.


  Whenever practical, SPOKE also adheres to the Biolink model. While not strictly an ontology, the Biolink model aims at standardizing the types and relational structures present in biomedical knowledge graphs.

The Biomedical Data Translator project (Translator, for short) (https://ncats.nih.gov/translator) is a novel and ambitious undertaking by the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences involving a large and collaborative cadre of scientists from a variety of scientific domains including semantic representation, computer science and biomedical experts
