# Highlights

To allow for a more fine-grained assignment of RNA types and subtypes, all RNAcentral sequences have been annotated with Sequence Ontology terms. The RNAcentral database continues to grow and provide a central data resource for the RNA community.

RNAcentral is freely available at https://rnacentral.org.

RNAcentral continues to grow (Figure 1) with the incorporation of 16 new Expert Databases since the last publication (1).

In this paper, we discuss the new data and focus on the following major new features:

Newly integrated 2D structure information

Improved sequence similarity search

Transition to Sequence Ontology to annotate RNA types


A key strength of the method is the ability to visualize some of the largest structured RNAs, such as the human large subunit ribosomal rRNAs (LSU) with >5000 nucleotides (Figure 2). The LSU templates are displayed using a set of new 3D structure based templates from RiboVision (13). In addition, RiboVision provided a set of 3D structure based small subunit (SSU) rRNA templates that improves the representation of species-specific expansion segments in rRNA.

The Betacoronavirus sequence search is available at https://covid19sequencesearch.github.io.

Since its inception, RNAcentral has used the INSDC feature table (http://www.insdc.org/files/feature_table.html) and ncRNA vocabulary (http://www.insdc.org/rna_vocab.html) to annotate sequences with different RNA types. However, the INSDC classification lacks precision and does not distinguish between different rRNA types, such as SSU, LSU or 5S rRNAs, simply grouping them in a single category. Similarly, there were no specific terms for precursor microRNAs to separate them from other RNA precursors and maintain their connection with mature microRNAs. However, the Sequence Ontology (SO) (19) provides more granular terms for rRNAs, microRNAs and other RNA types. 


The resulting distribution of RNAcentral sequences by SO terms is shown in Figure 4.

GeneCards 	GeneCards is a searchable, integrative database that provides comprehensive, user-friendly information on all annotated and predicted human genes. 

We have also imported the Conserved RNA Structure (CRS) resource that computationally screened the human centered 100-way vertebrate sequence alignment from UCSC Genome Browser for conserved RNA secondary structures with CMfinder (35).
