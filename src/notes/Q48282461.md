# Highlights

There are other major problems associated with a universal DNA-profile database. Would foreign visitors be profiled on entry? What happens if the person who matches the crime-scene DNA profile has an alibi at a distant place? The database proposal places a reverse onus on accused people to show their innocence, even when there is no other evidence to link them to the crime. 

I accept without reservation that DNA evidence is a very useful tool in criminal prosecutions. However, the police and forensic services in the United Kingdom have at times failed to obey the rules with regard to DNA evidence (see, for example, cases referred to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, refs 6 and 7). Even now, the system has faults that need to be addressed before any future developments are considered.
