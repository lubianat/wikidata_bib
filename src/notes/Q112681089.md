# Highlights

The Human Disease Ontology (DO) (www.disease-ontology.org) database, has significantly expanded the disease content and enhanced our userbase and website since the DO’s 2018 Nucleic Acids Research DATABASE issue paper.

The DO’s updated website provides multifaceted etiology searching, enhanced documentation and educational resources.

The DO innovates interoperability between the DO and other ontologies through the integration of logical definitions formulated via ontology imports to define disease features and etiology.

Notable new terms include SARS-CoV-2 related diseases and over 1000 OMIM genetic disease subtypes. 


The DO’s clinical utility has been enhanced through the integration of the diverse and interconnected etiological genetic risk factors and environmental drivers of disease, to better represent complex disease by linking DO terms with those of related biomedical ontologies via highly structured design patterns. 

 We introduced the use of Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) mapping terms (https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) (28) (skos:narrowMatch, skos:exactMatch and skos:broadMatch) to express mapping relationships and reconcile differences between the DO’s cross-references. 

 These novel views of disease provide a unique perspective, such as exploring related diseases or disease mechanisms through the lens of common disease drivers (genetic risk factors, biological, chemical or ecological factors), phenotypes, symptoms, mode of inheritance, or infectious agent.

  The DO website provides publicly available documentation of curation methods, lists and links to the DO’s contributors and documented users, shares services offered via the DO’s website, documents peer-reviewed publications, and provides access to the DO’s educational videos on the DO’s YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/DiseaseontologyOrgDOID), a quarterly newsletter and the DO’s Tweets.
