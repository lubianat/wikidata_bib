# Highlights
The Regulatory Circuits project is one of the largest efforts for integrating human cell genomics data to predict tissue-specific transcription factor-genes interaction networks. In spite of its success, it exhibits the usual shortcomings limiting its update, its reuse (as a whole or partially), and its extension with new data samples. To address these limitations, the resource has previously been integrated in an RDF triplestore so that TF-gene interaction networks could be generated with two SPARQL queries. 

We provide a modular RDF representation of the Regulatory Circuits, called Linked Extended Regulatory Circuits (LERC).

In total it contains 3,910,794,050 triples and is available as a SPARQL endpoint.

<!-- Damn that is a large number of triples -->

First, we designed the structure of the sample-specific graphs as well as the SPARQL queries for computing the weights associated to TF-genes relations.

The SPARQL query for computing weightP is given in Fig. 2, where SAMPLE must be replaced by the identifier of an actual sample. 

he RDF version of the dataset is under the Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. The SPARQL queries used to generate the sample and tissue-specific TF-gene graphs are available on GitHub https://github.com/mlouarn/RCsparql/. The generated turtle files are available at https://zenodo.org/record/4889146.

The RDF model is supported by the regulatorycircuits.owl ontology provided on the GitHub repository (cf. Availability section).

The queries query-samplesInAnatomicalLocation.rq, query-samplesInCellType.rq and query-samplesInDisease.rq are federated queries that leverage the mappings to Uberon, the Cell Ontology and to the Human Disease ontology to retrieve the samples that match criteria requiring some ontology-based reasoning.
