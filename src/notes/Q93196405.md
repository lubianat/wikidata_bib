# Highlights

We  investigated  SARS-CoV-2  potential  tropism  by  survey-ing  expression  of  viral  entry-associated  genes  in  single-cell  RNA-sequencing   data   from   multiple   tissues   from   healthy   human  donors. 

The study offers a useful resource for further lines of inquiry with valuable clinical samples from COVID-19 patients and we provide  our  data  in  a  comprehensive,  open  and  user-friendly  fashion at www.covid19cellatlas.org.


We  also  assessed  ACE2  and  TMPRSS2  expression  in  developmental  datasets  from  fetal  tissues,  including liver, thymus, skin, bone marrow, yolk sac and lung, and found little to no expression of ACE2 in all but fetal liver and thymus (Fig. 1a)  where  there  was  no  co-expression  with  TMPRSS2  (data  not shown) except for a cluster of medullary thymic epithelial cells (Fig. 1a)


In  this  study,  we  explored  multiple  scRNA-seq  datasets  gener-ated  within  the  Human  Cell  Atlas  (HCA)  consortium  and  other  resources  and  found  that  the  SARS-CoV-2  entry  receptor  ACE2and viral entry-associated protease TMPRSS2 are highly expressed in nasal goblet and ciliated cells
