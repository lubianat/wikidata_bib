# Highlights
YY1 generally occupies active enhancers and promoters across cell types

 Here, we show that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) contributes to enhancer-promoter structural interactions in a manner analogous to DNA interactions mediated by CTCF.
We next investigated whether changes in DNA looping occur upon global depletion of YY1 in mESCs. HiChIP for H3K27ac, a histone modification present at both enhancers and promoters, was performed before and after YY1 depletion to detect differences in enhancer-promoter interaction frequencies.

YY1-YY1 interactions occur predominantly between enhancers and promoters and to a lesser extent between insulators (Figures 1E and S1Aâ€“S1D). At insulators, CTCF binds to a relatively large and conserved sequence motif (when compared to those bound by other transcription factors); these same sites tend to be bound in many different cell types, which may contribute to the observation that TAD boundaries tend to be preserved across cell types.
