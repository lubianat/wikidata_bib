Using the brainbow to trace lineages in early mouse development
===============================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q58836377]  

# Highlights
We found that at both the 4–8 cell stage, and the 8–16 cell stage, most blastomeres contribute primarily to the TE. We also observed that contributions of8–16 cell stage blastomeres to the TE or ICM are more variable than the contributions of 4–8 cell stage blastomeres to these lineages. In the future, this system can be used to trace multiple cell lineages during development beyond the blastocyst stage.
