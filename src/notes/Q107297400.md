# Highlights

Citation recommendation for research papers is a valuable task that
can help researchers improve the quality of their work by suggesting relevant
related work.

Farber and Jatowt [14] distinguish between
(1) local citation recommendation which aims to provide citations for a short passage
of text, and global citation recommendation which uses the documentsâ€™ full text or
abstract as the input. Here, we focus on the task of global citation recommendation

To facilitate further research, we release all our
corpora and source code: https://github.com/arthurbra/citation-recommendation-kg.

--> Nice

Other initiatives organise scientific knowledge in a structured manner with community effort, such as Gene
Ontology [10], WikiData [28] with encyclopaedic knowledge, or Papers With Code [24]
and Open Research Knowledge Graph [16] for research contributions.

For evaluation, analogous to related
work [4,9], we use only papers that cite at least four papers within the KG which re-
sults in 720 query documents and 4,069 citations links
