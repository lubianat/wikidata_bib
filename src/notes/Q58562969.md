# Highlights

Roughly 1 year into the feasibility phase, we describe the program's conception, the rapid coalescence of teams and team members, the novel mechanisms of interaction and communication, and the emergent collaborative culture and community that we believe are driving the early success of the program.

The Translator program is funded via an atypical funding mechanism: an Other Transaction Award (OTA).5 The OTA is not a contract, cooperative agreement, or grant. Rather, the OTA offers much greater flexibility and allows NCATS to engage traditional partners (i.e., academic institutions) in novel ways, engage nontraditional research partners (e.g., any adult applicant, regardless of professional affiliation or educational background), and negotiate terms and conditions that focus team efforts, spur innovation, facilitate collaborative problem solving, and support rapid changes in direction in response to project needs.
