# Highlights

 This paper describes Thalia, which is a semantic search engine that can recognize eight
different types of concepts occurring in biomedical abstracts. Thalia is available via a web-based interface
or a RESTful API. A key aspect of our search engine is that it is updated from PubMed on a daily basis.
We describe here the main building blocks of our tool as well as an evaluation of the retrieval capabilities
of Thalia in the context of a precision medicine dataset.
Availability: Thalia is available at http://nactem.ac.uk/Thalia_BI/

To recognize named entities from the literature, Thalia uses components of Argo (Rak et al., 2012), which is a text mining workflow system.
This includes NER modules for chemicals, drugs and metabolites (Kolluru et al., 2011; Nobata et al., 2011), genes, diseases and proteins (Rak
et al., 2014), species (Wang et al., 2010), and anatomical entities (Pyysalo
and Ananiadou, 2014). These models are based on dictionary matching as
well as conditional random fields models trained using human-annotated
data. The recognition step is followed by a normalization (Batista-Navarro
et al., 2016) to concepts from the following ontologies: ChEBI (chemicals), DrugBank (drugs), HMDB (metabolites), HGNC (genes), UMLS
Metathesaurus (diseases), UniProt (proteins), NCBI (species) and CARO
(anatomical).


The search system was implemented using Elasticsearch1
, which can
be accessed from a web-based interface written in Javascript (Fig. 1).
Semantic search is enabled by expanding the query area or by interacting
with the different entity facets, which suggest the most frequent entities to
narrow down the list of retrieved documents. 

Semantic search capacity of Thalia, which involves textual as well
as concept matching. This latter type of matching enables the retrieval of documents regardless of whether the same string occurs in the query and the documents, but depending on whether the same concept is present in the query and the retrieved documents.
