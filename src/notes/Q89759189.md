# Highlights


English Wikipedia, containing more than five millions articles, has approximately eleven thousands web pages devoted to proteins or genes most of which were generated by the Gene Wiki project

We applied the recently developed reduced Google Matrix (REGOMAX) algorithm in order to extract the network of hidden functional connections between proteins in Wikipedia. In this network we discovered tight communities which reflect areas of interest in molecular biology or medicine and can be considered as definitions of biological functions shaped by collective intelligence.

We recapitulate the results of Wikipedia protein community analysis and annotation in the form of an interactive online map, which can serve as a portal to the Gene Wiki project.

We conclude that the structure of global Wikipedia network can improve the annotation of protein functions by amplifying the wisdom of the crowd effect.

Such an effort was made in the past for representing human genes in Wikipedia, the Gene Wiki project, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wiki. By 2008, a massive import of approximately 8000 gene-specific pages from Entrez Gene database was made, which boosted the community-based annotation of genes [9]. The initial set of protein page “stubs” have been complemented by adding the knowledge about protein-protein interactions, represented by hyperlinks between pages. 

Wikipedia potentially provides a platform for application of the “wisdom of the crowd” (or, “collective intelligence”) mechanism known to be effective in other fields, including network biology [13]. In applications of crowdsourcing to solving complex problems, it can be sometimes advantageous to combine efforts of experts of different levels [14]

Hidden protein links are explained by the existence of connected Wikipedia page sequences (paths) of hyperlinks through the rest of the Wikipedia network that connect two protein pages

The shortest path length itself, however, is not a good measure of hidden link between two nodes of the graph, since it does not reflect the global topology of the Wikipedia network, e.g., the total number of shortest paths, connecting two nodes. By contrast, the weight of the link, estimated through the application of the reduced Google matrix, reflects the global topology of the rest of network and the probability to arrive from one protein page to an other one via a random walk with restart through the rest of the graph.

As a conclusion, a number of direct and hidden connections between proteins from Wikipedia are not found in the existing databases, which reflects relative independence and non-redundancy of two sources.

Altogether, these observations indicate increasing integration of the Gene Wiki project into the global Wikipedia context, a trend which will certainly persist in the future. It remains an interesting question what can be a practical use of of the protein function definition derived from the Wikipedia structure. Another interesting question is how to use the insights obtained from analysing the topology of hidden protein connections, in order to guide further evolution of the Gene Wiki project. For example, it would be interesting to identify missing biological functions or topics which do not yet form tight clusters in the Wikipedia network
