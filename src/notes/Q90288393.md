# Highlights

CellTagging and longitudinal tracking of fibroblast to induced endoderm progenitor reprogramming reveals two distinct trajectories: one leading to successfully reprogrammed cells, and one leading to a ‘dead-end’ state, paths determined in the earliest stages of lineage conversion. We find that expression of a putative methyltransferase, Mettl7a1, is associated with the successful reprogramming trajectory;

Sequential lentiviral delivery of CellTags (heritable random barcodes) enables the construction of multi-level lineage trees. Here, we apply CellTagging to transcription factor-induced direct lineage reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced endoderm progenitors (iEPs), a self-renewing cell type that has both hepatic and intestinal potential3,16

These clonal dynamics and lineages can be explored on our companion website, CellTag Viz (http://www.celltag.org/)
