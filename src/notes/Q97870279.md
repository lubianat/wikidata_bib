# Highlights

We present self-reporting transposons (SRTs) and use them in single-cell calling cards (scCC), a novel assay for simultaneously measuring gene expression and mapping TFBS in single cells. 

A notable lacuna in the single-cell repertoire is a method for jointly assaying transcriptome and TF binding. Such a method would lead to the genome-wide identification of TF binding sites across multiple cell types in complex tissues.

Here, we present single-cell calling cards (scCC), an extension of transposon calling cards that simultaneously profiles mRNA content and TF binding at single-cell resolution.

After sequencing, the cell barcodes shared between both libraries are used to connect individual insertions to specific cell types.

To establish broad utility for scCC, we sought to record TF binding in vivo.
