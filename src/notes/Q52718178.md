# Highlights

Gliomas with histone H3 lysine27-to-methionine mutations (H3K27M-glioma) ariseprimarily in the midline of the central nervous system of young children

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing in 3321 cells from six primary H3K27M-gliomaand matched models. We found that H3K27M-glioma primarily contain cells thatresemble oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC-like).

he cells’profiles group pri-marily by tumor of origin (Fig. 1A and fig. S3), buttwo clusters contain cells from multiple tumors,expressing markers of either microglia (such asCD14,CX3CR1,andAIF1)oroligodendrocytes(such asMBPandPLP1)(Fig.1,AandB),suggest-ing that they are nonmalignant cells.

Next, we profiled 863 single cells from severalmodels derived from BCH869—including patient-derived xenograft (PDX), gliomaspheres (GS), anddifferentiated glioma cells (DGC)
Cells from the PDX most closelyapproximated malignant cell states in the primarytumor, whereas each in vitro model recapitulatedsome, but not all, of these states (Fig. 4, A andB, and fig. S19A).

H3K27M-glioma alsooverexpress the PRC1 subunit BMI1 and are sen-sitive to its inhibition, either alone or in combi-nation with PDGFRA inhibition, hinting at apotential compensatory mechanism for PRC2dysfunction (Fig. 4E). Thus, lineage-defined andsomatically altered cellular programs in H3K27M-glioma suggest complementary opportunitiesfor therapeutic intervention in these incurablemalignancies.
