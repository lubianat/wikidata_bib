# Highlights
 To circumvent these deficits data architects may collaborate with scientists to transform and curate data. This paperâ€™s example of a data collection describes the electrical properties of outer hair cells isolated from the mammalian cochlea. The data is expressed with a variant of The Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), mirrored to provide the metadata and nested data architecture used within the Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) format.

 The need to share and aggregate data is even more obvious in fields where the experimental throughput is notoriously slow and where it is usually necessary to sacrifice experimental animals in the interest of scientific discovery

 Hair cells located in the base of the cochlea respond to higher frequencies (up to 43 kHz in the guinea pig) with the best frequency decreasing towards the apex of the cochlea, reaching a minimum at the apex (e.g., the guinea pig is at 0.060 kHz) [24]. 

 More recently, audiological data relevant to human pediatric hearing health can be found and deposited through the AudGenDB portal [37]. This is a web-based query database (beta version, v2.0) with clinical data
