# Highlights

From Impressionism and Pop Art to phosphorylationsites and interacting atom pairs, the realm of curationhas been expanded. The recent growth ofbioinformatics, driven by exponentially growing data,advanced computing techniques, and increased funding fromprivate and governmental organizations, has created the needfor novel strategies to adequately capture, store, and analyzethe multitude of data present in the scientific literature

The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource(IEDB) at http://www.immuneepitope.org [1,2] was establishedto capture, house, and analyze complex immune-epitopeâ€“related data extracted from the scientific literature by a teamof specialized biocurator.

The level of detail and precision that we aspire to capturecan lead to disagreements over the specifics. Issues as simpleas assigning an effector cell type, the semantics used todescribe an assay type, or even the qualitative result can leadto a great deal of discussion

The expansion of bioinformatics andits applications paints a promising future for thebiocurator.

--> Nice writing technique, coming back to the painting semantic field.
