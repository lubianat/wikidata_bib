# Highlights

The Disease Ontology (DO) database (http://disease-ontology.org) represents a comprehensive knowledge base of 8043 inherited, developmental and acquired human diseases (DO version 3, revision 2510). The DO web browser has been designed for speed, efficiency and robustness through the use of a graph database. Full-text contextual searching functionality using Lucene allows the querying of name, synonym, definition, DOID and cross-reference (xrefs) with complex Boolean search strings.

The research and clinical communities have developed and utilized a variety of vocabularies in order to systematically record mortality and morbidity classifications, to standardize clinical and event healthcare reporting, to index Medline articles or to interconnect biomedical concepts defined across hundreds of disparately developed vocabularies, coding systems, thesauri and classifications. Although these vocabularies and ontologies include disease and disease related concepts and terms, none of them are ‘organized’ around the concept of disease.

The DO was developed to create a single structure for the classification of disease which unifies the representation of disease among the many and varied terminologies and vocabularies 

DO's directed acyclic graph (DAG) present terms linked by computable relationships in a hierarchy (e.g. brain glioblastoma multiforme is_a brain glioma, and brain glioma is_a brain cancer) organized by interrelated subtypes (e.g. Brill-Zinsser disease is_a epidemic typhus, and epidemic typhus is_a typhus)

The DO is logically structured into major types of disease to enable guided expansion of the ontology.

The DO web-browser was constructed using Web 2.0 and semantic web technologies. At the forefront of these is the Neo4j graph database server (http://neo4j.org/).

GeneAnswers has been downloaded 2000 times by >1000 members of the bioinformatics community since July 2010. ‘DOGA’ (Human Disease Gene Annotation Database) is a beta version tool for examining disease-gene annotations through data available in Gene Wiki or in the NCBI GeneRIFs (http://doga.nubic.northwestern.edu)

The authors would like to thank the past and current members of the DO Advisory Board: Michael Ashburner, Judith Blake, Rex Chisholm, Suzanna Lewis, Maryann Martone, Chris Mungall, Alan Ruttenberg, Richard Scheuermann and Barry Smith for their invaluable guidance
