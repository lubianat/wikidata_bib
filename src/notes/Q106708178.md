# Highlights

Here, we describe a dataset with information about monogenic, rare diseases with a known genetic background, supplemented with manually extracted provenance for the disease itself and the discovery of the underlying genetic cause. We assembled a collection of 4166 rare monogenic diseases and linked them to 3163 causative genes, annotated with OMIM and Ensembl identifiers and HGNC symbols.

The data are available under CC0 license as spreadsheet and as RDF in a semantic model modified from DisGeNET, and was added to Wikidata. 
--> Nice!

We produced a mapping dataset, which links rare, monogenic diseases to their causative genes (and vice versa), backed up by the publication which proves the genetic cause for a disease for the first time, or historic provenance.

To create an RDF file (according to standards as stated here: https://www.w3.org/TR/hcls-dataset/) a modified version of the DisGeNET RDF model was developed. The code to create the RDF is available at: https://github.com/BiGCAT-UM/raredisease-omim/tree/master/rdf. All data files are available in this Figshare collection, and the actual version discussed here is version 3

To illustrate the use of our dataset we used the results of the SPARQL queries to find that the first description of a rare disease was from 1788 (Olof Ekman) about osteogen-esis imperfecta (Fig. 2A). Later in 1988 and 1989, mutations in two collagen genes, COL1A124 and COL1A225, were identified as responsible for this disease.
Network of genes causing diseases. To investigate the dataset, a network of gene-disease relationships was created using Cytoscape software. The network analysis shows 2357 gene-disease causative relationships in which one gene causes one disease (Fig. 3A upper left). P
