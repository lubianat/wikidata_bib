# Highlights
Daniel Mietchen4,5,

For example, within the biomedical sciences,
there have been recent articles about the
accuracy and completeness of drug information in Wikipedia [2], Wikipedia as a
source of information in nursing care [3]
and mental disorders [4], and making
biological databases available through
Wikipedia [5].

Topic Pages are the version of record of a
page to be posted to (the English version of)
Wikipedia. In other words, PLoS Computational Biology publishes a version that is
static, includes author attributions, and is
indexed in PubMed. In addition, we intend
to make the reviews and reviewer identities
of Topic Pages available to our readership.
Our hope is that the Wikipedia pages
subsequently become living documents that
will be updated and enhanced by the
Wikipedia community, assuming they are
in keeping with Wikipediaâ€™s guidelines and
policies, either by individuals, or, perhaps
as is already happening in medicine and
molecular and cell biology, by something
more organized, or with a more formal
review structure.
