# Highlights

 getting your computer set up in exactly the same way as somebody else’s computer is set up. That is just ridiculously difficult
A text-based ‘command-line’ application, Docker has dozens of options, and building a working Dockerfile can be an exercise in frustration.

Colaboratory (free), Code Ocean, Gigantum and Nextjournal (the latter three have free and paid tiers) let users write code in the cloud as well and, in some cases, bundle it with the data to be processed.

codify your computing environment as early as possible in a project, and stick with it
!!!!

Several journals now use Code Ocean for peer review and to promote computational reproducibility.

it took a week to get the Code Ocean environment working. “The reviewers seemed to really like it,”
