# Highlights

 In this study, we used two complementary single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches, SMART-Seq and 10x, to profile ~1.2 million cells covering all regions in the adultmouse isocortex and hippocampal formation,and derived a cell type taxonomy comprising 379 transcriptomic types.

 --> Damn, that's a lot

But absent of a systematic study, we still do not have a complete picture of the number of cell types in the cortex and how they are distributed across different regions. This knowledge is an essential prerequisite toward understanding how different cortical regions interact with the rest of the brain and how they carry out their individual functions. 

We used Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3) ontology (http://atlas.brain-map.org/) to define brain regions for profiling and boundaries for dissections


We provide a web interface to present summarized information about each cell type in the form of a cell type card (https://taxonomy.shinyapps.io/ctx_hip_browser/; Fig. S7). Each cell type card includes information about cluster annotation, sampling metrics, marker gene expression, relationship to other clusters within its neighborhood and the equivalent cluster in previously published datasets (if present
