# Highlights

We hypothesized that we could leverage technological advances to use voice recognition as an interactive input to query and visualize genomic information.

We developed an Amazon Alexa skill called Gene Tracer that allows users to use their voice to find disease-associated gene information, deleterious mutations, and gene networks, while simultaneously enjoy a genome browser-like visualization experience on their screen.

With the large-scale and deep-learning capabilities of NLP, voice recognition has successfully been brought to the everyday life  of  humans.  Siri  (Apple),  Alexa  (Amazon),  and  Google  Voice  have dominated  the  smart  artificial  intelligence  voice  assistant  market.  These smartassistants enable users to efficiently interact with their devices andcan be used as a hub for home entertainment and research purposes.


The server will output the relevant genes based on the geneâ€™s summary  from  NCBI  and  show  it  on  the  screen.  For  example,  if  a  user wants to find the top genes related to breast cancer, Gene Tracer will show a screen like in Figure 1B.

In  summary,  we  developed  the  first  voice-controlled  smart  genome browser called Gene Tracer.
