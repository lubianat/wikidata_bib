# Highlights
ever, the ability to comprehensively explore the diverse interactions between lncRNAs and other functional elements is limited. To this end, we developed LIVE (LncRNA Interaction Validated Encyclopaedia), an interactive resource to integrate the diverse interactions of functional elements with lncRNAs.

The current release of LIVE contains the validated interactions of 572 lncRNAs in humans and mice with 103 proteins, 209 genes, 56 transcription factors and 194 diseases. LIVE provides an interactive interface with charts and figures to aid users in searching and browsing interactions with lncRNAs. LIVE will greatly facilitate further investigation into the regulatory roles of lncRNAs and is freely available.

To provide a comprehensive collection of experimentally validated interactions with lncRNAs, we manually curated the available publications to construct LIVE (Figure.1). 

LIVE will continue to be curated and updated in the coming years, and the next update will focus on providing more kits to help analyze the metadata of the included literature.
