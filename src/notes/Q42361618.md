# Highlights

We used genetic lineage tracing, single-cell RNA sequencing, and organoid culture approaches to show that Lgr5 and Lgr6, well-known markers of stem cells in epithelial tissues, are markers of mesenchymal cells in the adult lung. Lgr6+ cells comprise a subpopulation of smooth muscle cells surrounding airway epithelia and promote airway differentiation of epithelial progenitors via Wnt-Fgf10 cooperation

Defining the identities and behavior of lung mesenchymal cells is challenging due to the lack of defined markers for these populations.

In contrast with Lgr6+ cells, the majority of lineage-labeled Lgr5+ cells were located exclusively in the alveolar compartments and none of the lineage-labeled cells were airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) 

Lineage-tracing studies confirmed that there are rare cells expressing CCSP in lineage-labeled Lgr5+ and Lgr6+ cells (Figures S2H and S2I). Each of the cell populations suggested by cluster analysis expressed a unique gene expression signature (Figures 2D and 2E).
