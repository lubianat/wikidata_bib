# Highlights

 The new GO-CAM annotation framework was notably improved, and we formalized the model with a computational schema to check and validate the rapidly increasing repository of 2838 GO-CAMs. In addition, we describe the impacts of several collaborations to refine GO and report a 10% increase in the number of GO annotations, a 25% increase in annotated gene products, and over 9,400 new scientific articles annotated. 

  The GO ontology provides a formal structure that defines the universe of possible gene functions (GO terms), and the relationships between them (6). Standard GO annotations are assertions that relate a specific gene with a specific ontology term describing its function, along with the evidence for that assertion (7). GO-CAMs are a relatively new component in the GO resource (2). GO-CAMs link multiple standard GO annotations into a more comprehensive model of gene function and allow causal influences between molecular activities to be detailed using relations from the Relation Ontology (https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations). GO-CAMs currently are of two main types: those that include causal influences between activities (e.g. a biological pathway), and those that do not.

  GO-CAM is a strict semantic, descriptive and computable model that enables curators to link together standard GO annotations and enrich them with biological context

  We have implemented a computational schema for GO-CAM using ShEx (Shape Expressions), a formal language for describing structures in Resource Description Format (RDF) graphs (https://shex.io), also used in projects such as Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Schemas).

  <!--     - 1.3.3. Wikidata as a platform for representation of biological knowledge -->

  Led by the Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the SynGO consortium is an international collaboration between 15 laboratories and GO to improve the curation of synapse biology

  We have improved the ontology and annotations related to transcription factors, in collaboration with the GREEKC consortium (https://www.greekc.org/) 

  hrough a collaborative process with domain experts both within and outside the GOC, we create new terms to describe new findings, and obsolete or merge terms that are unnecessary, incorrect or redundant.

  PAINT annotation is a GO curation effort to manually infer functions based on phylogenetic relationships (16). 

  Statistics are now computed and tracked at each monthly GO release (http://geneontology.org/stats.html) and serve two purposes: (i) informing users of the changes in both the ontology and annotations and (ii) checking and validating the GO annotations of contributing groups before the GO publishes them in a public release.

Noctua curation platform
Noctua (http://noctua.geneontology.org) is a set of curation tools that supports the collaborative creation and review of standard GO annotations and GO-CAMs (Figure 3). 
Querying GO-CAMs
The relative simplicity of standard GO annotations enabled their widespread use by allowing users to ask actionable biological questions (e.g. ‘what are the functions of a given gene’; ‘what are the scientific articles and the experimental evidence supporting that a gene has a certain function’). 


 These advanced queries are designed with the SPARQL Query Language (https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) using the GO SPARQL endpoint http://sparql.geneontology.org.

 In February 2019, we released an updated website for the GO, to help the 240 000 annual users find, browse, download and interact with GO data. 

 The GO Helpdesk (http://help.geneontology.org/) is the general entry point for users having questions or feedback for GO.
