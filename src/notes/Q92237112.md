# Highlights

: Here, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework, named scReClassify, for ‘post hoc’ cell type
identification from scRNA-seq datasets. Starting from an initial cell type annotation with potentially mislabelled cells,
scReClassify first performs dimension reduction using PCA and next applies a semi-supervised learning method to
learn and subsequently reclassify cells that are likely mislabelled initially to the most probable cell types. 

we proposed scReClassify, a post hoc cell type classification tool based on a
semi-supervised learning approach. Taking the initial cell
type annotations as soft-labels, it subsequently identifies
and reclassifies potentially misclassified cell

As a
simple, easy to use R package, we hope scReClassify will be
a useful addition to the scRNA-seq data analysis toolkit.
