# Highlights
• Mechanisms of inflammatory adverse events induced by checkpoint blockade
• Colitis-associated differentiation of CD8 Trm cells to cytotoxic effector cells
• Persistence and expansion of CTLA-4+ Treg cells
• Inflammatory pathways provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention

Monoclonal antibodies targeting the CTLA-4 or PD-1/PD-L1 pathways can induce durable responses in a wide range of human malignancies but can also induce inflammatory toxicities, collectively referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These irAEs can affect any organ system and remain a major limitation of checkpoint inhibition (Larkin et al., 2015; Postow et al., 2015, Postow et al., 2018)

+CPI colitis is frequently characterized by continuous inflammation from the anus to the cecum, and histopathological analysis identified a high proportion of lymphocytes and increased numbers of apoptotic epithelial cells

(C) Identification of colon CD45+ immune cell clusters across all samples (n = 5–6 subjects per cohort).

Large clusters of cycling (Ki-67+) CD8+ and CD4+ cells were predominantly localized in the LP in +CPI colitis patients treated with CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies (Figure 2L); fewer CD8+ and CD4+ cells were observed in the LP of healthy subjects. These data demonstrate striking colitis-associated changes in colonic CD8+ T cells, characterized by a shift from Trm to cytotoxic, cycling effector T cells.
