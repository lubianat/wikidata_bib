# Highlights

In this study we use a combination of 
lineage tracing, gene disruption, and single cell RNA-seq assays to explore the properties of 
the lateral plate ectoderm of the proto-vertebrate, Ciona intestinalis.


imple genetic perturbations result in the inter-conversion of one 
sensory cell type into another. Particular efforts focused on the bipolar tail neurons (BTNs) 
since they arise from tail regions of the lateral plate and possess properties of dorsal root 
ganglia, a derivative of neural crest in vertebrates

It has been suggested that the BTNs are related to dorsal root ganglia, which are derived 
from neural crest cells in vertebrates5. This observation raises the possibility that tail regions 
of the lateral plate ectoderm possess “proto-neural crest” properties5,


Approximately 5000 cells were sequenced in order to obtain sufficient coverage 
(~3×) to ensure reliable detection of PSCs, BTNs, and transformed cell types

We therefore suggest that a 
compartmentalized lateral plate preceded the advent of the vertebrates, and served as a 
common source for the evolution of both cranial placodes and neural crest.
