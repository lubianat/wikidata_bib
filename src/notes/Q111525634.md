Publication date : 01 of January, 2021  

# Highlights
We present emrKBQA, a dataset for answering physician questions from a structured patient record.
The questions and logical
forms are generated based on real-world physician questions and are slot-filled and answered
from patients in the MIMIC-III KB (Johnson
et al., 2016)
This community-shared release consists
of over 940000 question, logical form and answer triplets with 389 types of questions and
â‰ˆ7.5 paraphrases per question type

However, emrQA is restricted to answers within
or across clinical notes. Clinical notes are known
to capture relations between entities (treatments for
problems, side-effects of a drug), signs or symptoms (palpitations), temporal and causal events

We develop and release
emrKBQA, the first large-scale community-shared
dataset for patient-specific QA on structured patient
records1
. 

Roberts and Demner-Fushman (2016, 2015) introduce target logical form definitions and present
a rule based method for converting natural language questions over structured data in the EHR
into logical forms.
