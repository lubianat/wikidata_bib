# Highlights

We used single-cell RNA sequencing to interrogate early cardiac progenitor cells as they become specified 
during  normal  and  abnormal  cardiogenesis,  revealing  how  
dysregulation of specific cellular subpopulations has catastrophic 
consequences. 

Network-based computational method for single-
cell RNA-sequencing analysis that predicts lineage-specifying 
transcription factors2,3 identified Hand2 as a specifier of outflow 
tract cells but not right ventricular cells, despite the failure of right 
ventricular formation in Hand2-null mice4

The heart develops from diverse cell lineages specified from two 
pools of mesodermally derived cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), the first 
and second heart fields (FHF and SHF, respectively) and multipotent 
neural crest cells1

We used pseudotemporal ordering to test the 
hypothesis that this cluster represents a mixed population of early  
myocardium progenitors (EMP)7 (Extended Data Fig. 6aâ€“e). 

Analysis of CPC populations reveals early specification 
dynamics of myocardial subtypes. a, UMAP plot of AHF and pSHF
