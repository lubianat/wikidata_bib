# Highlights
 Here, following a negative selection
strategy combined with single-cell RNA sequencing of 768 transcriptomes of mesenchymal
cells from a genetically engineered mouse model of breast cancer, we define three distinct
subpopulations of CAFs

CAF subclasses represent histologically distinct entities. In
order to conclusively demonstrate the existence of spatially distinct subsets of CAFs within malignant lesions, we visualized all
subsets by using fluorescent reporters or immunostaining.
Indeed, simultaneous detection of the vCAF marker Nidogen-2,
the mCAF marker PDGFRÎ±, and the dCAF marker SCRG1,
identified three distinct stromal populations with divergent
growth patterns and localization in relation to the nests of tumor
cells (Fig. 4d).
