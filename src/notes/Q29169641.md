# Highlights

We have therefore developed an interactive annotation tool, EXTRACT, which helps curators identify and extract standard-compliant
terms for annotation of metagenomic records and other samples. Behind its web-based
user interface, the system combines published methods for named entity recognition of
environment, organism, tissue and disease terms

--> Cool system.

 By hovering the mouse cursor over the text tags or the table rows you can visually inspect which words have been identified as which entities. To easily collect extracted annotations, e.g. for use in an Excel spreadsheet, direct Copy to clipboard and Save to file (tab-delimited) are supported.


Figure 2. EXTRACT highlighting of terms. To quickly identify metadata-relevant pieces of text in a larger document, users may perform a full page
tagging. The highlighted entities can indicate candidate segments for subsequent inspection and term extraction. As shown, identified organisms
mentions are highlighted in yellow and environment descriptors in orange.


Finally, in light of the positive feedback from the evaluators, we have begun work on expanding the scope of
EXTRACT beyond annotation of environment metadata.
Given the generality of the interface and workflow, it
should be applicable to many other tasks, including extraction of drugâ€“target associations and annotation of protein
function and localization. To support such use cases, we
are extending the dictionary to include also names of
genes, proteins, small-molecule compounds, and Gene
Ontology terms. Although still under development, this
new functionality can already be previewed via the
EXTRACT2 beta bookmarklet, which is available from
the EXTRACT website.
