Group formation, relatedness, and the evolution of multicellularity

  [@wikidata:Q86916694]  

# Highlights
It has been argued that a high ge- netic relatedness (r) between cells played a pivotal role in the evolutionary transition from single-celled to multicellular organisms, because it leads to reduced conflict and an alignment of interests between cells [1–17].

We tested this hy- pothesis with a comparative study, comparing the form of multicellularity in species where groups are clonal (r=1) to species where groups are potentially nonclonal

Dictyostelium species can remain in their unicel- lular state for many generations, without the need to form a multicellular fruiting body, which they do only under certain harsh conditions, and so we classify them as facultatively multicellular

Obligate multicellularity is feasible in species with nonclonal group formation—all it requires is that cells always aggregate to complete a necessary part of their life cycle (i.e., not just under certain conditions). Given that we found no evidence for nonclonal organisms having evolved obligate multicellularity, this suggests that the genetic conflict that arises from lower relatedness (r % 1) inhibits this major transition in individuality

For example, Dictyostelium purpureum and Volvox carteri are both simple, having a sterile somaand the samenumber of cell types, but only V. carteri has undergone the major transition to obligate multicellularity.

--> "Same number of cell types" is a rather frail claim

Some single-cell organisms have more than one cell type
