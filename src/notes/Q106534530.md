# Highlights

Here we develop approaches for imaging myelopoiesis in mice, and generate atlases showing the differentiation of granulocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells. 


Strategies for imaging myelopoiesis

During myelopoiesis, common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) generate monocyte–dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs) and granulocyte–mono-cyte progenitors (GMPs).

These results indicate that endothelial-derived CSF1 is required for emergency production of dendritic cells in response to infection. Extended Data Fig. 10 summarizes our findings

Extended Data Fig. 10: Architecture of myelopoiesis at steady state and after infection
The models show the spatial distributions of, and average distances between, the indicated cells at steady state and four days after infection with L. monocytogenes.
