# Highlights

The International Society for Biocuration (ISB) was created in 2009 specifically to promote biocuration, the product of multidisciplinary teams of database curators, software developers and bioinformaticians. Biocurators, whose work facilitates research and education across the life sciences, create and maintain a wide variety of online tools and databases, covering topics as diverse as biochemical structures, chromosomal features and phenotypes of mutant genes.

DATABASE, The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation, was launched in 2010 to support the growing need of the research community to discuss a range of issues related to the creation, development and maintenance of biological databases, and to strengthen communication between database developers, curators and users.
