# Highlights

 So every day she downloaded PDF updates released by the ministries of health of the virus-stricken countries, and converted the numbers into computer-readable tables. Rather than keeping these files to herself, she posted them to GitHub.com, 

 At the time, GitHub was “really the only place on the Internet that you could interact with these data as data, and not as a PDF”

. As with the Open Tree of Life, the project’s main website doesn’t have github.com in the URL address, so casual visitors wouldn’t necessarily know that they are interacting with version-control software — but the files are openly available in a GitHub repository for more sophisticated users.

Loman is a member of the ZiBRA (Zika in Brazil Real Time Analysis) project, an ongoing Brazilian surveillance effort that collects Zika-virus samples across the country and sequences and analyses them in real time. Traditionally, Loman says, DNA sequence data go to archives such as GenBank — and these data will too. But it can take time for those sites to release data to the public. GitHub, he says, provided a faster and more flexible way to disseminate draft data sets, rather like tweeting a research finding in advance of publication.
