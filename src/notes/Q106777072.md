# Highlights

In this report, we present interacCircos, an R package for creating interactive Circos plots through the integration of JavaScript-based libraries. interacCircos can simply and flexibly implement 14 track-plot functions and 7 auxiliary functions for presenting large-scale genomic data in interactive Circos plots.


 In recent years, some Circos-derived   tools,   such   as   Circoletto   (Darzentas,   2010),   CIRCUS(Naquinet al., 2014) and Rcircos (Zhanget al., 2013), have beendeveloped  to  facilitate  the  drawing  of  Circos  plots.  Among  thesetools,  BioCircos.js  (Cuiet  al.,  2016),  circosJS  (Nicolas  Girault,2020) and NG-Circos (Cuiet al., 2020) try to address the fact thatthe  original  Circos  implementation  is  not  interactive.

BioCircos.R (Loan, 2019) is an R imple-mentation that can generate interactive Circos plots, but this pack-age was developed based on BioCircos.js, which limited it to onlyfive  functional  module
