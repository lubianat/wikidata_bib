# Highlights

This paper presents an LBD system
based on the open discovery paradigm exploiting NLP techniques and UMLS medical concepts mapping, to provide a set
of tools useful to discover unknown relationships
z

The system
has been evaluated on the problem of discovering new candidate genes potentially related to dilated cardiomyopathies
(DCM)

Two literatures LA and LC referring to the set of
concepts A and C, respectively, are disjointed if there is no
overlapping between the two sets A and C.

After the Swanson work, many systems for automating the
LBD process have been proposed. T
Weeber et al. have developed a system called DAD (DiseaseAdverse Reaction Drug-Drug) [4]

Similarly to the system presented in Weeber [4], our system
considers the whole abstract of the article and extracts the
UMLS concepts contained. 

Recent trends in translational research go towards multidisciplinary approaches where bioinformatics play a relevant role
in providing methodologies to support the investigation. LBD
systems provide the researchers with a set of tools useful for
analysing the scientific literature and extracting potential new
knowledge.
