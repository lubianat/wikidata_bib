# Highlights
countless hours for individual researchers to assemble on their own. Since their inception, the MODs for the predominant biomedical model organisms [Mus sp. (laboratory mouse), Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio, and Rattus norvegicus] along with the GOC have operated as a network of independent, highly collaborative genome resources. In 2016, these six MODs and the GOC joined forces as the Alliance of Genome Resources (the Alliance)

Model organism databases (MODs) have played a central role in the success of animal models in basic and biomedical research for decades by providing ready access to knowledge about genome features, their functions, and their associated phenotypes

Acknowledgments of the MODs and the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) in the peer-reviewed scientific literature demonstrate that these resources are widely used to support science funded across all National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutes and have global impact. 

 Start-up funding from AstraZeneca, along with stable funding provided subsequently by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), supported the centralized development of the GO and related software tools, as well as coordinated gene function curation efforts among the first GOC members: FlyBase, the Mouse Genome Database (MGD), and the Saccharomyces Genome Database. The GOC has since grown to include > 30 active members

The Alliance of Genome Resources serves the same diverse research communities supported by the existing collective of model organism genome resources including: (i) human geneticists and clinical researchers who want access to all model organism data, which are the main sources of experimental annotation of human genes through orthology;
