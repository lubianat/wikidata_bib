# Highlights

We performed a meta-analysis of 31 lung single-cell RNA-sequencing studies with 1,320,896 cells from 377 nasal, airway and lung parenchyma samples from 228 individuals. This revealed cell-type-specific associations of age, sex and smoking with expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL

Here, we chart the cell-type-specific expression patterns of ACE2and  accessory  proteases  by  integrated  analysis  of  116  single-cell  and  single-nucleus  RNA-sequencing  (scRNA-seq  and  snRNA-seq)  studies, including 31 studies of the lung and airways, and 85 studies of  other  diverse  tissues.


ACE2+TMPRSS2+   epithelial   cells   were   most   prevalent   (in   order)  within  the  ileum,  liver,  lung,  nasal  mucosa,  bladder,  testis,  prostate  and  kidney  (Fig.  1a). 

Enrichment (âˆ’log10adj. P value) of KEGG disease and non-disease pathway gene sets in either highly significant genes across all tissues (top) or in specific tissues (lung and nose; bottom)

Our  meta-analysis  provides  a  detailed  molecular  and  cellular  map  to  aid  in  our  understanding  of  SARS-CoV-2  transmission,  pathogenesis  and  clinical  associations.  We  herein  demonstrated  how  this  can  be  done  despite  restrictions  on  data  sharing.  As  the  HCA  progresses,  we  envision  such  meta-analyses  in  the  context  of  other  diseases,  for  example,  by  combining  large  healthy  refer-ence  atlases  with  both  epidemiological  and  genetic  risk  factors.  In  parallel,  as  new  atlases  are  generated  from  COVID-19  tissues  and  models,  their  integration  will  further  advance  our  understanding  of this disease
