# Highlights

We used comprehensive transcriptome analysis of 622 single mouse neurons to classify them in an unbiased manner, independent of any a priori knowledge of sensory subtypes. Our results reveal eleven types: three distinct low-threshold mechanoreceptive neurons, two proprioceptive, and six principal types of thermosensitive, itch sensitive, type C low-threshold mechanosensitive and nociceptive neurons with markedly different molecular and operational properties.

We performed RNA-seq on 799 single cells from the mouse lumbar
DRGs

population. See Supplementary Table 4 for
summary of neuronal population expression
profile for genes presented in this panel.
(e) Gene ontology analysis of neuronal types.


(b) Proposed new sensory neuron classification based on unbiased full
RNA transcriptome analyses. Gene products on top are suggested markers for identification of subtypes (red, new markers; black, selected previously
used markers). Gene products at bottom are examples of a distribution of gene products commonly studied in the field. Proposed relation of sensory
subtypes to modality-specific functions or previous functional classification is indicated below brackets. Myel., myelinated; Unmyel., unmyelinated.
