# Highlights

. To that extent, we developed the Dragon Antimicrobial Peptide Database (DAMPD, http://apps.sanbi.ac.za/dampd) that contains 1232 manually curated AMPs. DAMPD is an update and a replacement of the ANTIMIC database.

<!-- website is down -->

Several analytical tools and relevant resources are integrated into DAMPD to support exploration and biological analysis of AMPs (http://apps.sanbi.ac.za/dampd/BioTools.php). For the same purpose we provided links to a number of additional resources.

This process automatically retrieved the new peptides of ‘antimicrobial’ category, but the final inclusion into DAMPD requires checking by a domain expert.
