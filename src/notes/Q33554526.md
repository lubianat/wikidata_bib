# Highlights

n September 2008, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) at The Jackson Laboratory initiated a search for dictionary-basedtext mining tools that we could integrate into our biocuration workflow. MGI has rigorous document triage and annota-tion procedures designed to identify appropriate articles about mouse genetics and genome biology. We currently screen1000 journal articles a month for Gene Ontology terms, gene mapping, gene expression, phenotype data and other keybiological information. Although we do not foresee that curation tasks will ever be fully automated, we are eager toimplement named entity recognition (NER) tools for gene tagging that can help streamline our curation workflow andsimplify gene indexing tasks within the MGI system


 related problem is that PDF conver-sions required to produce plain text (TXT) submissionsfor bioNLP systems are often error prone, and special char-acters, symbols, text formatting and columnar text flowcan be lost in translation.Biologists and text m

wo-lettersynonyms, such as ‘‘IN’’ for CD44—Indian Blood Group,also caused high false positives as the OBA concept recog-nition tool interpreted all incidences of the word ‘in’ as agene mention for CD44


Our goal, now and in the future, is to incorporate bioNLPtools into the MGI biocuration workflow such that theyimprove the overall efficiency of our curators withoutcompromising  the  quality  of  our  literature  curation.
