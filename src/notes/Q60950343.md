# Highlights
The HPO continues to collaborate with clinical adopters to improve specific areas of the ontology and extend standardized disease descriptions. The newly redesigned HPO website (www.human-phenotype-ontology.org) simplifies browsing terms and exploring clinical features, diseases, and human genes.

A key feature of the HPO is its logical interoperability with basic research ontologies such as the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (MP) (43), Uberon (44) and the Cell Ontology (45).

Table 1.Community workshops and collaborations aimed at HPO content expansion and refinement

Furthermore, this collaboration has produced the HPO-ORDO Ontological Module (HOOM in which the HPO and Orphanet Rare Diseases Ontology can be used together).
 For instance, an increased level of galactonate in red blood cell (HP:0410063) is associated with patients with galactosemia (MONDO:0018116; gene: GALT).

The new Clinical modifier subontology allows more expressive and precise disease definitions and can also be used to annotate individual patients
Exomiser utilizes the HPO to find potential disease-causing variants from whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data

The labels, synonyms and textual definitions of the HPO are also being translated into several languages including French, Spanish, Italian, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Turkish, Japanese, Russian and Chinese; this is critical to ensure equitable health care and precision public health (See project homepage below).


Clinical features in HPO are also connected to disease nosologies (medical classification schemes) such as ORDO, OMIM, and MONDO. These relationships are typically curated from literature; however, they can also be crowd-sourced. Phenotate (http://phenotate.org), which was developed in the framework of the HIPBI-RD project, is a web-based tool that allows undergraduate or medical students, as well as medical residents, to annotate OMIM and ORDO diseases with HPO phenotypes by completing classroom exercises
