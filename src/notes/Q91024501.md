# Highlights

Single-cell analyses reveal novel dendritic cell subsets
d Major cDC2 subsets differentially express T-bet and RORgt
d Distinct pro- and anti-inflammatory potential of T-bet+ and
Tbet– cDC2s

 we identified two principal
cDC2 lineages defined by distinct developmental
pathways and transcriptional regulators, including
T-bet and RORgt, two key transcription factors
known to define innate and adaptive lymphocyte
subsets.

. Classical DCs (cDCs), defined by the expression of
integrin-aX (CD11c) and major histocompatibility complex class
II (MHC class II) (Steinman et al., 1979), comprise two subsets,
cDC1s and cDC2s (Guilliams et al., 2014). T


Shared gene expression
among individual T-bet+ cDC2 clusters suggests that these
clusters represent a single cellular population with graded
gene expression states. 

To identify discriminative cell surface markers that would best
classify cells into T-bet+ cDC2s or T-bet– cDC2s, we combined
the earth mover’s distance (EMD)-based measure of differential
expression with a measure of classification—

Analysis of TF expression confirmed
enrichment of the predicted transcriptional regulators in the
respective DC subset, including Nr4a2 and Nr4a3 for T-bet+
DCs, and Cebpa and Nfix for T-bet– DCs (Figure 4D). N

To identify human counterparts to the mouse
cDC2A subset, we undertook a scRNA-seq analysis of
Lin(CD3,CD56,CD19)–
CD14–
CD11c+
HLA-DR+ DCs isolated
from human spleen (Figure S6C).
