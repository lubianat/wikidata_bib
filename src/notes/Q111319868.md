# Highlights

We synthesized oyster distribution data across the west coast of North America to develop conservation strategies for the native Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida), and to characterize populations of the non-native Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas). We designed a user-friendly portal for data entry into ArcGIS Online and collected oyster records from unpublished data submitted by oyster experts and from the published literature. We used the resulting 2,000+ records to examine spatial and temporal patterns and made an interactive web-based map publicly available. 

Oysters are important foundation species that have declined globally [10]. In the Eastern Pacific, the one native oyster species between Alaska, U.S. and Punta Eugenia, Baja California, Mexico is the Olympia oyster, Ostrea lurida [11–13]. It declined throughout its range to functional extirpation over several decades spanning the late 1800s to early 1900s before any ecological studies documented the early extent of population sizes or the distribution of oyster beds. The area of their beds in the late 1900s and early 2000s is now estimated at <1% of their former extent [14].

The substrate on which the observed oysters were documented was inferred from observer notes, associated iNaturalist photos, and Google Earth (especially seawalls and riprap). Oysters were deemed “common” if it could be inferred based on scale of the photo and if 100+ oysters per 20 m2 could be extrapolated, but were otherwise recorded as “present but unknown abundance.”

We collected 2,296 oyster records made by over 150 observers from 1602 to 2020; these data are archived and publicly available (S3 and S4 Files).
