# Highlights

 The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive
epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during
gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread
coordinated epigenetic rearrangements at enhancer marks, driven by TET-mediated demethylation,
and a concomitant increase of accessibility. In striking contrast, the methylation and accessibility
landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast.


. We applied scNMT-seq (singlecell Nucleosome, Methylome and Transcriptome sequencing12) to profile 1,105 single cells
isolated from mouse embryos at four developmental stages (Embryonic Day (E) 4.5, E5.5,
E6.5 and E7.5)

We next asked how the epigenomic patterns associated with germ-layer specification arise
during development. DNA methylation levels in endoderm and mesoderm-defining
enhancers follow the genome-wide dynamics, increasing from an average of 25% to 80% in
all cell types (Figure 3 and Extended Data Fig. 9

The opposite pattern is
observed for chromatin accessibility; accessibility of meso- and endoderm-defining
enhancers initially decreases from ~40% to ~30% (following the genome-wide dynamics)
before becoming more accessible (~45%) upon lineage specification

Consistently, Tet TKO embryos are able to initiate gastrulation, but by E8.5 they display
defects in mesoderm-derived cell types, including heart or somites


. Future studies that use
multi-omics approaches to dissect cell populations have the potential to transform our
understanding of cell fate decisions, with important implications for stem cell biology
