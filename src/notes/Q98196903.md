Naming human genes
==================
  
  [@wikidata:Q98196903]  

# Highlights
A Comment in this issue summarizes the current practices of the HGNC and provides advice to researchers on the naming and reporting of novel genes. We endorse these guidelines and encourage the community to follow these suggestions when naming new human genes.

For clarity and specificity, each gene is
assigned only one symbol. Isoforms such as splice variants or alternate transcripts for the most part do not receive their own names.

--> Yeah, but the symbols may change with time.

We ask that the approved gene symbols (https://www. genenames.org/) always be used. To avoid ambiguity, the HGNC ID (HGNC:number)
can be used; each gene has a unique identity associated with the sequence. We ask authors to use the approved gene symbol at least once in the manuscript’s abstract. We also agree with the HGNC’s guidance to use italics to denote genes, alleles and RNAs, to distinguish them from proteins.
