# Highlights

We applied thisanalysisworkflow to a human coronary artery scRNAdataset and revealed 36distinct derivations of chondrocyte-like and fibroblast-like cells from smooth muscle cells 37(SMCs), and show the key changes in gene expression along their de-differentiation path

Consistent with recent 134scRNA-seq studies in atherosclerotic models, we identified abundant fibroblast(FB) and 135chondrocyte-like (CH) cells, as well as cells with an osteoblast-like(OS) expression profile136(Figure1B)[4]

--> Classification but not definition

. This corroborates earlier findings 154showing that SMCs maytransition or de-differentiate into ‘fibromyocytes’—SMCs that have 155undergone a phenotypic modulationto an extracellular matrix producing cell type within the 156atherosclerotic lesions[5,8]


# Comments
--> Oh, it is areanalysis. Cool, but I want to check the originals
