From primal scenes to synthetic cells
=====================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q64097538]  

# Highlights

But what kind of entity would a synthetic cell really be? I assess this question from a philosophical perspective,

BaSyC, a project that aims to use basic components to build a synthetic cell that convincingly mimics all the functions of a living cell. 

The object pole (that is, the synthetic cell) and the subject pole of the knowledge production process (the scientists and research groups working on this challenge).

Triangulation, which means that we need a third position from which we can attempt to unravel the interaction between the subject and the object. Such a position may be provided by novels, movies or plays about the desire to create artificial life.

‘Synthetic biology’ had already been coined by Stephane Leduc  to refer to research which involved growing crystals in solutions to mimic and explore organic forms.

Goethe (explored the idea of creating life in  Faust. Also Mary Shelley (Frankenstein) via HG Wells (The Stolen Bacillus) up to contemporary writers.
