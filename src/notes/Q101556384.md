# Highlights

Gramene (http://www.gramene.org), a knowledgebase founded on comparative functional analyses of genomic and pathway data for model plants and major crops, supports agricultural researchers worldwid

. We train plant researchers in biocuration of genes and pathways; host curated maize gene structures as tracks in the maize genome browser; and integrate curated rice genes and pathways in the Plant Reactome.

Since our last publication (5), we have added 49 new plant genome browsers (total 93); gene-orthology based pathway projections for 40 new species

We maintain a news blog (https://news.gramene.org/blog) and a social media presence (https://twitter.com/GrameneDatabase and https://www.facebook.com/Gramene) to provide information on the most recent releases, , and events at scientific meetings. We continue to organize live webinars and recordings, which serve as online tutorials for users and are available in Gramene's YouTube channel (https://goo.gl/ln9RLD).
