# Highlights

Memory T cells are unable to differentiate into
the Th2 phenotype, and acquire a Th17-like phenotype in response to iTreg polarization.
Single-cell analyses show that T cells constitute a transcriptional continuum that progresses
from naïve to central and effector memory T cells, forming an effectorness gradient
accompanied by an increase in the expression of chemokines and cytokines

. We polarized T N and T M toward four T
helper phenotypes (Th1, Th2, Th17, and iTreg), as well as
including IFN-β due to its role in multiple sclerosis 29,30 .
# Comments

Single cell RNA-seq reveals a T cell effectorness gradient. Our
results showed that the gene expression programs induced in
response to cytokines differ substantially between T N and T M .
Whilest T N constitute a uniform cell population, T M are com-
posed of subpopulations including central (T CM ) and effector
(T EM ) memory cells, as well as effector memory cells re-
expressing CD45RA (T EMRA ).
