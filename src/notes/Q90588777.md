# Highlights

Typically, a consensus is made on a crucial markers needed in the immunostaining panel, sometimes on the particular fluorochrome conju- gates and rarely on a complete set of methods for sample preparation. The term “stan- dardization” is used to describe the complete set of methodical steps, while
“harmonization” is used for partial agreement on the method.

Most applications of clinical cytometry aim for interpretation (e.g., “leukemia of B-cell precursor origin is present in the sample”) and aim for precise enumeration (CD4 counts, CD34 counts)

Flow cytometry presents a paradox as all generated data
are in a digital format from their inception; however, the data interpretation is mostly visual by an experienced analyst.

Several studies have indicated that manual analysis is a major source of variation (13,14), and the best documented example of improving reproducibility by gating strategy unifi- cation was the ISHAGE guidelines on CD34+ progenitor enu- meration (15,16).

Uniform sets of reagents (antibody panels) were assembled and tested together with the staining SOP (33), and software tools were built that enabled the analysis of the standardized data

Data analysis plays a major role in the reproducibility of any flow cytometry study. Any cytometry study should be publi- shed with a full explanation of the gating strategy as described in the “The minimum information about a flow cytometry experiment” (MIFlowCyt) (83), which summarizes that a complete set of information about a published cytometry experiment is mandatory for Cytometry Part A journal submissions.
