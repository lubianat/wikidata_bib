# Highlights

. DBpedia extracts and
provides structured data for various crowd-maintained information sources such as over 100 Wikipedia language editions as well
as Wikimedia Commons by employing a mature ontology and a stable and thorough Linked Data publishing lifecycle. Wikidata,
on the other hand, has recently emerged as a user curated source for structured information which is included in Wikipedia. In
this paper, we present how Wikidata is incorporated in the DBpedia eco-system. 

. In addition to the independent growth of DBpedia and Wikidata, there is a number of structural complementarities
as well as overlaps with regard to identifiers, structure,
schema, curation, publication coverage and data freshness that are analysed throughout this manuscript.

Coverage DBpedia provides identifiers for all structural components in a Wikipedia language edition. This includes articles, categories, redirects
and templates. Wikidata creates common identifiers for concepts that exist in more than one language. For example, not all articles, categories,
templates and redirects from a Wikipedia language edition have a Wikidata identifier. On the
other hand, Wikidata has more flexible notability criteria and can describe concepts beyond
Wikipedia. 

Normalizing datasets
to a common ontology is the first step towards data
integration and fusion. Most companies (e.g. Google,
Yahoo, Bing, Samsung) keep these datasets hidden;
however, our approach is to keep all the DBpedia data
open to the community for reuse and feedback.

Besides the stable dump availability we created
http://wikidata.dbpedia.org for the provision of a
Linked Data interface and a SPARQL Endpoint.

We present an effort to provide an alternative
RDF representation of Wikidata. Our work involved
the creation of 10 new DBpedia extractors, a Wikidata2DBpedia mapping language and additional postprocessing & validation steps.
