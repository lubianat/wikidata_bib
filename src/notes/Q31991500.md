# Highlights

To develop a model for a new type of topic-specific
overview resource that provides efficient access to distributed
information, we designed a database called ‘GeneCards’. It is
a freely accessible Web resource that offers one hypertext ‘card’
for each of the more than 7000 human genes that currently have
an approved gene symbol published by the HUGO/GDB
nomenclature committee

Web-accessible resources in a way that provides immediate insight into the
function of a gene. Importantly, we did not attempt to integrate all the information available, but to select the data that
would be most helpful for providing an overview of current
knowledge.

Using the text processing capabilities of Perl, we were able
to develop a package of scripts we termed ‘PLUK’ (Package
for Locating Useful Knowledge) that search different data
sources for information about human genes with approved
symbols (http://www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/).
