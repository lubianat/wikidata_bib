# Highlights
The Death Domain (DD) superfamily, which is one of the largest classes of protein interaction modules.

The current version documents 175 PPI pairs among the 99 DD superfamily proteins. The DD database provides a detailed summary of the DD superfamily proteins and their PPI data.

Accumulating structural information, however, indicates that each subfamily has unique structural characteristics, such as a more flexible and exposed third helix in the DDs, the presence of an RxDL-motif in the DEDs, an interrupted first helix in the CARDs and relatively small third helix (or no well defined third helix) in the PYDs.

In the human genome, 37 proteins with DDs, 7 proteins with DEDs, 33 proteins with CARDs and 22 proteins with PYDs have been identified.

The DD database can be accessed at http://www.deathdomain.org.

A control panel on the left side of the toolbar allows users to choose each of the DD subfamilies and PPI categories.

Therefore, the aim of this database is to provide the scientific community with a comprehensive and integrated tool for efficiently, conveniently and accurately extracting information about PPIs of the DD superfamily
