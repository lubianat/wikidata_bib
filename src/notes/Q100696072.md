# Highlights

In this biennial update, we report a 20% increase in CTD curated content and now provide 45 million toxicogenomic relationships for over 16 300 chemicals, 51 300 genes, 5500 phenotypes, 7200 diseases and 163 000 exposure events, from 600 comparative species. Furthermore, we increase the functionality of chemical–phenotype content with new data-tabs on CTD Disease pages (to help fill in knowledge gaps for environmental health) and new phenotype search parameters (for Batch Query and Venn analysis tools)

 As well, we introduce new CTD Anatomy pages that allow users to uniquely explore and analyze chemical–phenotype interactions from an anatomical perspective.

 All CTD interactions are annotated with taxa identification (enabling data comparison across species) and are linked to original source articles (providing transparency and traceability).

 CTD independently curates both chemical-induced diseases and chemical-induced phenotypes, wherein we operationally differentiate and define a phenotype as a non-disease biological event (e.g. signal transduction, cell proliferation, apoptosis, immune system processes, ion transport, mitochondrial assembly, etc.).

 In 2020, we launched CTD Anatomy pages as a new public data feature for users (http://ctdbase.org/voc.go?type=anatomy). CTD leverages a modified subset of the ‘Anatomy’ tree branch from Medical Subject Headings (27–28) as its controlled vocabulary source that includes 1799 terms for anatomical structures and regions, physiological systems, fluids and tissues, cells and sub-cellular components. Currently, 870 anatomy terms are used in more than 247 000 chemical–phenotype interactions in CTD (http://ctdbase.org/about/dataStatus.go). 


  Finally, to help increase database interoperability, CTD Anatomy terms are mapped to other community-accepted anatomical vocabularies, including Uberon (29), which defines organs and tissues, and Cell Ontology (30), which describes cell-types; all matching Uberon and Cell Ontology terms, synonyms and accession identifiers are integrated into CTD Anatomy pages (Figure 2C) and are fully searchable.

  Second, we added 1658 new amino acid-based chemicals to CTD (http://ctdbase.org/detail.go?type=chem&acc=D000596). Previously, we had excluded certain chemical branches to help focus exclusively on environmental chemicals. However, during manual curation, CTD biocurators encounter amino acid compounds as either unique environmental chemicals (e.g. herbicide glyphosate or food flavoring sodium glutamate) or, more commonly, as laboratory reagents used to help dissect environmental molecular pathways (e.g. inhibitors L-NAME or ZVAD-FMK or receptor agonist n-methylaspartate, etc.). Adding this branch of amino acid-based compounds will increase the chemical landscape at CTD and enable a more robust curation of the scientific literature.
