# Highlights

s this process is spatially coordinated, knowing the cellular localizations was crucial to understand, for example, interactions between XCR1+ dendritic cells and T cells with high expression of XCL1, which are important to recruit dendritic cells into the medulla of the thy-mus. Yet another study inferred the 3D organization of bone marrow — instead of using tissue imaging to map the cells — ultimately identifying signalling between immune and non- immune cells53. These examples show how cell localization can help elucidate interactions between spatially proximal regions.

Tensor-   based  tools  are  the  most  mathematically  sophisticated group of tools. Although network com-putations  can  be  formulated  as  matrix  operations,  scTensor113 explicitly models ligand–receptor interac-tions using a tensor. A tensor of rank three is generated from the data, wherein two dimensions are for ligand and receptor expression by each cell type or cluster within the single- cell RNA- seq data set, respectively, and the third dimension represents all ligand–receptor interactions

TensorHigher N- dimensional generalizations of matrices and vectors. Vectors are tensors of rank 1, matrices are tensors of rank 2

Tucker decompositionDecomposing of a tensor of rank N as a product of a set of N matrices and one core tensor. Used to summarize data, similarly to principal component analysis.
