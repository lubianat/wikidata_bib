# Highlights
 We present the first steps towards a knowledge graph based infrastructure that acquires scholarly knowledge in machine actionable form thus enabling new possibilities for scholarly knowledge curation, publication and processing. The primary contribution is to present, evaluate and discuss multi-modal scholarly knowledge acquisition, combining crowdsourced and automated techniques.

In this article, we tackle the following research questions:
• Are authors willing to contribute structured descriptions of the key research contribution(s) published in their articles using a fit-for-purpose infrastructure, and what is the user
acceptance of the infrastructure?
• Can the infrastructure effectively integrate crowdsourcing
and automated techniques for multi-modal scholarly knowledge acquisition?
