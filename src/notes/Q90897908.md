# Highlights
We take advantage of the FANTOM5 sequencing datasets that represent the largest collection to date of genome-wide promoter usage in almost 2000 human samples.

This work provides evidence for the existence of additional regulatory mechanisms of the expression of neurodegenerative disease-causing genes by previously not-annotated and/or not-validated antisense long noncoding RNAs.

 Using tissue (UBERON) categories, antisense to MAPT, APP, and HTT and LRRK2, C9orf72, and PSEN1 clustered together with nervous and immune system groups, respectively. A less stringent overlap was observed for the other lncRNA genes and using cell ontology (CL) categories.
