# Highlights
As patients with rare diseases are estimated to constitute as much as 10% of the population (see Related links), there is increasing societal pressure to develop diagnostics and therapies for rare diseases.

a rare disease in the United States is defined by the 1983 Orphan Drug Act as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people, whereas the analogous legislation introduced in the European Union in 2000 considers a disease to be rare when it affects fewer than 1 in 2,000 people.

For example, different pathogenic variants in the PIK3CA gene are associated with several different rare diseases, including Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome, the megalencephaly–capillary malformation syndrome and several cancers and malformation syndromes (see Related links). Although involving variants in the same gene, these should be considered distinct diseases because their presentation and, more importantly, their treatment are different.

Regulators, scientists, clinicians and patient advocacy groups often cite ~7,000 as the number of rare diseases, or between 5,000 and 8,000 depending on the source (see Related links). 

 Ultimately, if knowledge on rare diseases is not collected and curated more effectively, many patients with rare diseases will remain underserved or neglected by healthcare systems.
