# Highlights
:We address the goal of curating observations from published experiments in a generalizable form;reasoning over these observations to generate interpretations and then querying this interpreted knowledge tosupply the supporting evidence. We present web-application software as part of the‘BioScholar’project (R01-GM083871) that fully instantiates this process for a well-defined domain: using tract-tracing experiments to studythe neural connectivity of the rat brain.

--> Nice, Robot Scientist vibes


The main contribution of this work is to provide the first instantiation of a knowledge representation forexperimental observations called‘Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design’(KEfED)

f all scien-tific claims could be made as succinct, citable, computa-ble elements (with appropriate justification from datasuitably attached), then the thread of a scientific argu-mentcouldbemadebylinkingtheseclaimsratherthanciting documents that act as their containers.

As a central part of our formal-ism, we distinguish betweenobservational assertions(based on specific data from carefully-planned experi-ments) andinterpretational  assertions(based on ahigher-level understanding of the phenomena under study).

--> Good distinction


We postulate knowledge con-structs for each type of assertion:
-  the‘ExperimentalDesign Model’(describing experimental design, data andassertions) and
-  the‘Domain-specific Reasoning Model’(describing knowledge within a subject that enablesscientiststo make predictions that may be tested experi-mentally)

Despite these methodological developments in thefield, our focus in this paper is concerned with using anexample data set that demonstrates theinterplay betweena specific experimental design model and its derivedinterpretation
# Comments

From the middle, it gets quite specific and a bit hard to read.
