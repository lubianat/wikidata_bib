# Highlights
Here we used bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomics data to confirm that POSTN is an asthma specific gene involved in core signaling pathways enriched in the bronchial epithelium during asthma.

 Our bioinformatics results confirmed that POSTN was consistently upregulated in the bronchial epithelium in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) bronchial epithelium.
