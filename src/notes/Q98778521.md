# Highlights

Visceral organs, such as the lungs, stomach and liver, are derived from the fetal foregut
through a series of inductive interactions between the deﬁnitive endoderm (DE) and the
surrounding splanchnic mesoderm (SM).

This identiﬁes a diversity of SM cell types that
develop in close register with the organ-speciﬁc epithelium.

The single cell data can be explored at: https://research.cchmc.org/
ZornLab-singlecell.

his identiﬁed 24 cell clusters that could
be grouped into nine major cell lineages based on well-known
marker genes: DE, SM, cardiac, other mesoderm (somatic and
paraxial), endothelium, blood, ectoderm, neural, and extra-
embryonic (Supplementary Fig. 1)

Both the DE and SM trajectories
progressed from a continuum of closely related cell states at E8.5
to transcriptionally distinct cell populations at E9.5
