# Highlights
ntegrated the information on muscle regeneration in a web portal. The scientific content annotated in this portal is organized into two information layers representing relationships between different cell types and intracellular signaling-interactions, respectively. The annotation of the pathways governing the response of each cell type to a variety of stimuli/perturbations occurring during muscle regeneration takes advantage of the information stored in the SIGNOR database.

. Although our understanding of regeneration processes is far from complete, the progress in the field would benefit from the assembly of models that take into account most of the available information. To address this issue, we conceived a web resource to organize prior knowledge about muscle regeneration processes in a structured and easily accessible format.

Myo-REG allows users to browse a variety of data types through a single platform at https://myoreg.uniroma2.it. The stored information is annotated by manually mining the literature or by automatically capturing information from other online resources.

This, sometimes, is the result of a compromise between alternative opinions. Cell identifiers are annotated according to the definition in the Cell Ontology section of Ontobee (Ong et al., 2017).
