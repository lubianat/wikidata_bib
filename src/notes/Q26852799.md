# Highlights

. The observation of iDG was first reported in mice with a heterozygous mutation in the Î±-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Camk2a) gene. These mice demonstrated cognitive and behavioral deficits similar to symptoms seen in schizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder and other psychiatric disorders (Yamasaki et al., 2008).

In addition to regulating the proliferation of DG neural progenitors, bHLH transcription factors can modulate the dentate migratory stream. Emx2 (empty spiracles homeobox 2) is a neuroepithelial transcription factor that was previously reported to play an important role in the development of the telencephalon by delineating the regionalization of the choroid plexus (von Frowein et al., 2006). However, it has been observed that Emx2 mutant mice also lacked the entire DG granule cell layer at birth, although the corresponding neuroepithelium appeared to be correctly specified (Savaskan et al., 2002)
