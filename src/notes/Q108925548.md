# Highlights
. In the present paper I shall first summarize Popper’s criticism of the traditional
method of definition, and then go on to comment critically on his own views on the form
and function of so-called nominalist definitions.

he develops his theory in a work on social philosophy – in his well-known
The Open Society and Its Enemies

The main feature of traditional methodology, traced back by Popper to
Plato and Aristotle, is essentialism.2 According to this methodology, the
aim of science is to discover and describe the essences of things. The
idea is that such essences are accessible to intellectual intuition and can
be spelled out in ‘essentialist’ definitions.

an essentialist definition
will have two functions: linguistic and ontological – to which we may add
a third, i.e. epistemological function.

He adds that “Aristotle’s essentialist definitions are the principles from which
all our knowledge is derived; they thus contain all our knowledge.”


2) the genetic aspect connected with the problem of
intuition, viz. “how we can get hold of definitions” (OS II, p. 11), which
strictly should be of no relevance, for – as Popper himself observes – “science does not ask how he [a scientist] has got his ideas, it is only interested
in arguments” (OS II, p. 16)

--> kind of art, in some sense

Popper underlines that his “main emphasis”
in introducing this new approach “is on the question whether the definition
is read from the right to the left or from the left to the right; or, in other
words, whether it replaces a long story by a short one, or a short story
by a long one”

The usefulness of
a nominalist definition consists in its contextual convenience and depends
on its consequences (LSD, p. 55). In short, nominalist definitions “do not
contain any knowledge whatever”; their unique function is “brevity” (OS
II, p. 14).


1. “... undoubtedly, the demand that we speak clearly and without ambiguity is very important, and must be satisfied” (OS II, p. 18).


‘the product arising from multiplying an integer by itself’, or ‘the ratio of two integers’.
We may now choose “arbitrarily” a short label or symbol as an abbreviation
of either of these expressions, say ‘prime number’.

Any reader of this article will therefore be
justified in objecting that this label surely is inappropriate if only because
it involves ambiguities


But obviously the arbitrariness of nominalist definitions, referred to frequently by Popper,11
and the demand for unambiguousness are not necessarily compatible.

--> Hmm, maybe this challenge is covered to some extent by the semantic web advances

In his book on the Open Society Popper suggests in a note that if there is a
danger of ambiguity we should introduce two different labels (II, p. 291,
note 44 (1))

As to clarity, Popper is rather modest, conceding that all our undefined
terms are vague: “We are always conscious, he says, that our terms are a
little vague (since we have learned to use them only in practical applications) and we reach precision not by reducing their penumbra of vagueness,
but rather by keeping well within it, by carefully phrasing our sentences
in such a way that the possible shades of meaning of our terms do not
matter” (OS II, p. 19)

--> That is golden

In agreement with Rudolf Carnap’s intensional analysis
of meaning, he argues – without, though, spelling this out in more detail
either here or in his other writings – that “every scientific language must
make use of genuine universals, i.e. of words, whether defined or undefined, with an undeterminate extension, though perhaps with a reasonably
definite intensional ‘meaning’.

Christoph von Mettenheim, for instance, writes in a recent
book, which reflects the “continuing relevance of Karl Popper,” that he
was “convinced by every word” he read in Popper’s writings, and he
adds: “One of the views which entirely convinced me was the theory of
methodological nominalism, as opposed to essentialism, in particular the
explanation of the role which definitions should play in science, which
Popper explains in Chapters 3 and 11 of The Open Society,” adding later
on: “His theory of definition, supported as it is by Tarski (1965), seems to
me a just evaluation of the role which definitions should play in science.”27


(4) his
contention that only nominalist definitions occur in science is untenable,
for this procedure does not offer any method of clarification of concepts

--> I do not know if I agree with this interpratation

Super good introduction to the views of Popper on definitions. 
Excellent gathering of quotes.
