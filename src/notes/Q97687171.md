# Highlights

 Here we profled a library of
drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved small molecules to identify candidate therapeutic
drugs for COVID-19. We report the identifcation of 100 molecules that inhibit viral
replication of SARS-CoV-2, including 21 drugs that exhibit doseâ€“response
relationships


The ReFRAME library has previously been used
to successfully identify potential therapies for tuberculosis14, Cryptosporidium15 and fibrosis16. Each of the compounds in this collection
has been previously optimized for efficacy, safety and bioavailability
