# Highlights
Using mouse models of hypervirulent TB
and influenza, we observed that exaggerated accumulation of parenchymal CD4+
 T
cells promotes lung damage. Low numbers of lung CD4+
 T cells, in contrast, are
sufficient to protect against hypervirulent TB. In both situations, lung CD4+
 T cell
accumulation is mediated by CD4+
 T cell-specific expression of the extracellular ATP
(eATP) receptor P2RX7.


Pathogen-specific effector CD4+ T cells 

In response to virulent H37Rv Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),
CD4+
 T cells expressing the fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 tend to stay within the
vasculature and produce high levels of IFN-γ, while cells expressing the CXC Motif
Chemokine Receptor 3 (CXCR3) tend to establish parenchymal residency and are
more effective in containing infection despite lower IFN-γ production in a per-cellbasis (Sakai et al., 2014; Sallin et al., 2017).

Here, we report that cell-intrinsic P2RX7 promotes the lung parenchymal
accumulation of effector CD4+
 T cells in response to TB and influenza, directly
promoting disease exacerbation. P2RX7-expressing CD4+
 T cells increase CXCR3
expression and can access the lung parenchyma. In the lung parenchyma, P2RX7
promotes the proliferation of effector CD4+
 T cells, further increasing their numbers
in the tissue

While most lung WT CD4+
 T cells
were found in the lung parenchyma of infected mice, P2RX7-KO CD4+
 T cells were
predominantly associated with the lung vasculature and excluded from the
parenchyma
