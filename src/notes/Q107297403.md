# Highlights
We rst identify dimensions for characterising ontologies to b e used as a basis
for noting which techniques and guidelines for building ontologies apply in dierent
circumstances We then give an o verview of the current state of the art noting that
most work addresses just a small part of the life cycle

We adopt the following as our working de nition of an ontology
an explicit account or representation of some part of a conceptualisation  

Formality the degree of formality b y whic h a v o cabulary is created and meaning is sp eci ed

Purpose the intended use of the ontology

Subject Matter the nature of the sub ject matter that the ontology is characterising 

Genericity Related to purp ose is the notion of genericity whic h is the extent to which
an ontology can or is intended to b e reused in a range of dierent situations 

Ideally an on tology builder should  rst have a clear idea of why the ontology is wanted
what it will b e used for and p ossible mechanisms for use  In practice these things are not
always easily come by 

If you really cannot clearly identify your purp ose you should consider whether it is worth
pro ceeding to build the ontology for you may encounter problems late

Once the purp ose and level of formality of the ontology is fairly well determined the next
step is to identify the scop e  The output for this phase is a set of concepts and terms covering
the full range of information that the ontology must characterise to satisfy the requirements
already identi ed  Below w e consider two main w ays to pro ceed with this pro cess
