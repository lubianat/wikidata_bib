# Highlights

To address these challenges, we constructed new resources to link the text with a model pathway; they are: the GENIA pathway corpus with event annotation and NF-kB pathway. Through their detailed analysis, we address the untapped resource, ‘bio-inference,’ as well as the differences between text and pathway representation

Though this type of inference is pervasive in the process of understanding text and unspecific to the biology domain, we call them “bio-inferences” for the sake of brevity.

Table 1 shows how single proteins in the extracted pairs of proteins correspond to nodes in the manually constructed pathway. On the other hand, single links in the PPI network are expanded into paths in the pathway.

. Table 3 depicts all of the entities in Figure 2. Among these entities, I4 and I5 are instances of the same biomolecule, the p50/p65, while I7, I8, and I9 are instances of the biomolecule, p50/p65/IkBa.

. These three sequences constitute the whole process of NF-kB activation; however, no single sentence in the pathway corpus reveals this whole process. Each sentence focuses on any of three aspects: (a) the functional state of NF-kB, (b) the molecular state of NF-kB, or (c) the molecular state of IkBa. Let us examine the following two sentences:
