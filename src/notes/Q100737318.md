MARS: discovering novel cell types across heterogeneous single-cell experiments
===============================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q100737318]  

# Highlights

Here we present MARS, a meta-learning approach for identifying and annotating known as well as novel cell types. MARS has a unique ability to discover cell types that have never been seen before and annotate experiments that are yet unannotated.

MARS accurately identifies cell types, even when it has never seen them before. Further, the method automatically generates interpretable names for novel cell types

Ability to generalize to an unannotated experiment and to capture the similarity of cell types across annotated and unannotated experiments.

We find that MARS aligns all cell types except the set of natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells change their position at every time point (Fig. 1c), indicating the existence of transcriptional changes.

MARS relies on the cell-type landmarks in the annotated experiments to probabilistically define cell type based on its region in the low-dimensional embed- ding space. Probabilities are assigned to landmarks in proportion to their probability density under Gaussian centered at a target unannotated cell type.

--> No discussion about naming!
