# Highlights
Given these problems, what is the state of the art in sequencestructure-function bioinfonnatics?

What is a gene?
Perhaps the biggest obstacle to accurate
gene counting is that even the definition of
a gene is unclear. Is it a heritable unit corresponding to an observable phenotype?
Or is it a packet of genetic information
that encodes a protein, or proteins? Or perhaps one that encodes RNA? Must it be
translated? Are genes genes if they are not
expressed?
As definitions vary, inevitably
so do estimates of the total number of
genes in sequenced genomes.

--> - 2.1. The concept of "gene"

The term "homology," a fundamental concept in bioinformatics, is often used incorrectly. Sequences are homologous if they are
related by divergence from a common ancestor (7).

Genomics-based drug discovery is
heavily dependent on accurate functional
annotation. Toward this end, bioinformatics
will need to deliver highly integrated, interoperable databases (and data "warehouses") that allow the user to reason over disparate data sources and ultimately enable
knowledge-based inference and innovation.
