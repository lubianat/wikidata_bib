# Highlights

We show that the EPCAM+ population is heterogeneous, comprising hepatocyte-biased and cholangiocyte populations as well as a TROP2int progenitor population with strong potential to form bipotent liver organoids


Our atlas comprises all the main liver cell types defined by the expression of marker genes, including hepatocytes, EPCAM+ bile duct cells (cholangiocytes), CLEC4G+ liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), CD34+PECAMhigh macrovascular endothelial cells (MaVECs), hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts, Kupffer cells, and immune cells

To facilitate interac-tive exploration of our human liver cell atlas, we created a web interface: http://human-liver-cell-atlas.ie-freiburg.mpg.de

LYVE1 and CD14 have been identified as markers that distinguish midzonal and central LSECs from periportal LSECs


A detailed analysis of the CD163+VSIG4+ Kupffer cell compartment revealed subpopulations with distinct gene expression signatures
 Rare EPCAM+ cells have been termed hepatic stem cells16; these can form dense round colonies when cultured and are bipotent progenitors of hepatoblasts, which differentiate into cholangiocytes or hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo16,17

 he central TROP2int population that was stratified as bipotent on the basis of FateID-predicted bias expresses genes that encode early developmental transcription factors such as HES1, which is essential for tubular bile duct formation21, and PROX1, an early specification marker for the developing liver in the mammalian foregut endoderm that is required for hepatocyte proliferation and migration during development22 (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, this population showed lower expression of hepatocyte genes such as HNF4A, HP and ALB and of cholangiocyte genes such as KRT19 and CFTR compared to the hepatocyte-biased and mature cholangiocyte populations, respec-tively

 Perturbed cell states in liver cancer

 To address this issue, we transplanted human liver cells from patient-derived hepatocyte and non-parenchymal cell fractions into FRG-NOD (Fah−/−Rag2−/−Il2rg−/− non-obese diabetic)  mice
