mRNA-Seq whole-transcriptome analysis of a single cell
======================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q28240611]  

# Highlights
Here we describe a single-cell digital gene expression profiling assay. Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only a single mouse blastomere.

Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only a single mouse blastomere, we detected expression of 5,270 more genes than microarrays using hundreds of blastomeres.

The correlation plots of the reads of plus and minus strands for a single blastomere of a four-cell stage embryo (a), a single wild-type oocyte (b), a single Dicer1?/? oocyte (c)and asingle Ago2?/? oocyte (d)

--> Are these cells instances of 4 different cell types? For me, of course. Why wouldn't they?

The transcriptome difference between Ago2?/? and wild-type oocytes (R ¼ 0.938; Fig. 4d) was clearly less than that between Dicer1?/? and wild-type oocytes (R ¼ 0.919; Fig. 4c),which is consistent with the fact that the
phenotype of Ago2?/? oocytes is similar to but milder than that of Dicer1?/? oocytes
