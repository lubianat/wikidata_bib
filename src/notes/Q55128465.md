# Highlights

Prompted by the frequency of concomitant use of prescription drugs with natural products, and the lack of knowledge regarding the impact of pharmacokinetic-based natural product-drug interactions (PK-NPDIs), the United States National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has established a center of excellence for PK-NPDI

The biggest hurdle against re-using NATPRO is the lack of textual definitions for the classes. One of the key use cases for standardizing terms in the PK-NPDI data repository is to help users easily locate studies of interest using queries that will include mention of study features

Spyrou and Lange reported on the development of a food-drug interaction ontology [8]. uc_FIDO is intended to serve as an unambiguous representation of food-drug interactions to be used by healthcare consumer-oriented knowledge sources. Of the 818 classes in uc_FIDO [9] none has a definition. Some of the design decisions described in the paper presenting uc_FIDO do not inspire confidence in the resulting ontology

The aim of our extension to DIDEO is coverage of the entire scope of pre-clinical and clinical experimental data for NPDIs.
