# Highlights

Before generalizing the rules for the relationships between targets, it is best to examine a specic
example. Chemicals that have the role p53 activator [8] obviously aect a certain target. The type of
eect is directly activates [9]. The type of the target is protein [10]. The target itself is the protein
encoded by the TP53 [11] gene
1
. Because the chemical CBL0137 [12] has the role p53 activator [8], it
can be inferred that CBL0137 [12] directly activates TP53 [11].

While not strictly necessary for the reasoning described above, it could be advantageous to enrich the existing role hierarchy with further roles that directly correspond to a given relationship and entity type (Figure 3), such that maintenance of children of these terms would only necessitate the curation of the target itself.
