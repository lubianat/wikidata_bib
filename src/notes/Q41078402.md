While the
large players, e.g., DBpedia, YAGO, or Wikidata, are often considered
similar in nature and coverage, there are, in fact, quite a few differences.
In this paper, we quantify those differences, and identify the overlapping
and the complementary parts of public KGs

Wikidata, which uses additional sources
plus a community editing process, has about tree times more instances. It is
remarkable that YAGO and Wikidata have roughly the same number of axioms,
although Wikidata has three times more instances

--> Wikidata has, as of today, about 6 times the number of items it had by then.

Since Wikidata provides live updates, it is the most timely source (together
with DBpedia Live, which is a variant of DBpedia fed from an update stream
of Wikipedia).

We have compared the coverage and level of detail for 25 popular classes. Some
key findings from this comparison include:
â€“ For person data, Wikidata is the most suitable source, containing twice as
many instances as DBpedia or YAGO, at a similar level of detail.
