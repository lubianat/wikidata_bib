# Highlights

To  address  these  challenges,  wedesigned a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling.

Finally, spatial transcriptomic data fromCOVID-19 patient autopsy tissues reveal distinctACE2expression loci, with macrophage andneutrophil infiltration in the lungs. 

The abundance of SARS-CoV-2 alignments from total RNA-seqwas sufficient to provide >10Ã— coverage of the viral genomes andyield high quality, full-length assemblies for 155 samples (Sup-plementary Fig. 6)
We then used a New York State-focused build of Nextstrainresulting  in  the  incorporation  of  our  155  genomes  with3541 sequences from GISAID (Fig.3a)

Notably, our phylogenetic analysis shows that the 20C cladecomprises the majority of known NYC samples, including thosesequenced outside of this study

These methods can helpmitigate the medical and socioeconomic harm from viral out-breaks, as well as establish protective surveillance networks thatcan help defend against future pandemics.
