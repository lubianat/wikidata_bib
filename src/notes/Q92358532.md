Successful implementation of life science cyberinfrastructure is improving data standards, ontologies, analytic workflows, and integrated database platforms for both model and non-model plant species.

Community and secondary databases for plants (and trees) continue to increase and often originate from a single transcriptome or genome project; however, dedicated funding for biocuration beyond the length of the initial project is limited (Harper et al., 2018). Until recently, the majority of databases focused on interfaces for searching curated data, genome visualization via browser, and basic sequence similarity functions.

Ontologies play an important role in the implementation of FAIR guidelines as they define shared vocabularies and improve the machine-readable aspect of data. Structured standards, such as the Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment (MIAPPE), provide guidelines for reporting on a phenotyping experiment (Ćwiek-Kupczyńska et al., 2016).

Researchers and funding agencies should look to existing cyberinfrastructure solutions to manage projects from start to finish, rather than at the end of the project. Metadata tagging, ontology term assignment, and raw data storage can be managed during small- or large-scale collaborations. Many community databases and other information resources can support this activity and keep data accessible only to project members until public release (Pommier et al., 2019; Wegrzyn et al., 2019).
