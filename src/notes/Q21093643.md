Overview of BioCreAtIvE: critical assessment of information extraction for biology
==================================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q21093643]  

# Highlights

 BioCreAtIvE focused on two tasks. The first dealt with extraction of gene or protein
names from text, and their mapping into standardized gene identifiers for three model organism
databases (fly, mouse, yeast). The second task addressed issues of functional annotation, requiring
systems to identify specific text passages that supported Gene Ontology annotations for specific
proteins, given full text articles


With BioCreAtIvE,
our goal was to assemble a suite of tasks that would:
• Attract researchers from both natural language processing and bioinformatics;
• Address problems of importance to the biology and bioinformatics community
• Create legacy training and test data suites that could be used for development and benchmarking of future
applications.
• Permit the assessment of the state of the art on real biological tasks.

In general, there is
an additional requirement that the papers contain "curatable" information – experimental findings on a particular
gene or gene product. This document retrieval task was the
inspiration for the KDD 2002 Challenge Cup Task 1 [24];
it also inspired the categorization task in TREC Genomics
2004 [28]
