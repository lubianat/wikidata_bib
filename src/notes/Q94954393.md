# Highlights


We contributed 3,084 new annotations for 494 entities, i.e., on average six new annotations per entity. This includeda total of 1,352 annotations for 40 prioritized microglial proteins implicated in AD and 66 miRs regulating their expression,yielding  an  average  of  twelve  annotations  per  prioritized  entity.

As previously, annotations resulting from this Uni-versity College London (UCL)-based project, fundedby the Alzheimer’s Research UK (ARUK) founda-tion, are labelled in GO browsers and/or secondary resources  as  contributed  by  ARUK-UCL

As a result of this project, 60 of the 106 prioritizedentities have been associated with a biological pro-cess GO term relevant to neuroinflammation (Fig. 1A,B), such as ‘glial cell activation’, ‘response to axoninjury’, or ‘cytokine production’, and/or their childterms


On the other hand, since scientific interest in ncR-NAs is more recent, and so fewer articles describingtheir  roles  in  cellular  events  have  been  publishedto date, our second objective was to annotate everyarticle  we  could  find,  which  described  an  interac-tion between a miR and the mRNA transcript of aprotein-coding  gene  from  the  priority  list  (Supple-mentary Table 1).

# Comments

Similar to the UK biocuration of alzheimer terms, perhaps a follow up? Yep, a follow up. Cool!
