# Highlights

This seminar, the fourth in the series on computational metabolomics, continued some
themes previously well developed, and explored many new ones. 

Open databases, repositories and
knowledge representation also featured their own discussions including Wikidata, CxSMILEs
and Wikipathways/RaMP-DB. Finally the important issue of integrating metabolomic data
with other relevant data types (e.g. genomics, proteomics etc) was discussed


3.7 Wikidata: empowering metabolomics research

nother difference is the liberal license/waiver, CCZero, which mimics the concept of public domain.
This allows many research domains across the world to adopt Wikidata to easily collect,
curate, and integrate data, including the life sciences [2]. Because Wikidata has application programming interfaces to add, update (e.g. curate), and retrieve data many tools
have been developed around it which empowers even more use cases.

 For metabolomics research Wikidata certainly has potential. It already includes 1.3 million common
chemicals (see https://scholia.toolforge.org/chemical/) and natural products [4] most
with external identifiers to compound databases like PubChem, EPA CompTox dashboard,
KEGG, HMDB, ChEBI, Chemical Abstractsâ€™ Common Chemistry, LIPID MAPS, and SwissLipids. But it also includes links to databases with experimental data, like MassBank,
NMRShiftDB, the PDB database, or to the primary literature. Databases that have been
using Wikidata include WikiPathways [1], Reactome, Complex Portal [6], and LOTUS [4].
