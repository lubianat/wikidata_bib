# Highlights

 Despite the remarkable progress in the field of marine natural products (MNPs) chemistry, there are only a few open access databases dedicated to MNPs research. To meet the growing demand for mining and sharing for MNPs-related data resources, we developed CMNPD, a comprehensive marine natural products database based on manually curated data.

 e are committed to providing a free data sharing platform for not only professional MNPs researchers but also the broader scientific community to facilitate drug discovery from the ocean.

  The commercial databases MarinLit (http://pubs.rsc.org/marinlit) and Dictionary of Marine Natural Products (http://dmnp.chemnetbase.com) are currently the most exhaustive and complete MNPs databases, but subscription fees may prevent their broader access to academic research


Generic chemical databases such as Reaxys (https://www.reaxys.com), PubChem (8), ChEMBL (9) and ChemSpider (10) include a certain number of MNPs, but the lack of sufficient annotations makes it difficult to retrieve MNPs from tens of millions of compounds. There is still a need for a free and complete professional MNPs database.

Isolation from the source marine organism is the only way to obtain a promising MNP if it cannot be synthesized. Therefore, it is necessary to record what organisms this compound was isolated from and where these organisms were collected, which is also critical to guarantee the reproducibility of relevant research and maximize the bioprospecting efficiency of MNPs (25

ome of the (newly) identified species that had not been published with an adequate taxonomic description were not included in the above taxonomic databases. Hence, their names were marked as nomina nuda (naked names) temporarily.
