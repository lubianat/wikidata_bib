# Highlights

Here we show that expression of an osteogenic growth factor, osteolectin13,14, distinguishes peri-arteriolar LEPR+ cells poised to undergo osteogenesis from peri-sinusoidal LEPR+ cells poised to undergo adipogenesis (but retaining osteogenic potential). Peri-arteriolar LEPR+osteolectin+ cells are rapidly dividing, short-lived osteogenic progenitors that increase in number after fracture and are depleted during ageing. Deletion of Scf from adult osteolectin+ cells did not affect the maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells or most restricted progenitors but depleted common lymphoid progenitors, impairing lymphopoiesis

To investigate the function of osteolectin+ cells, we inserted iCreER into the Oln locus to generate OlniCreER mice (Extended Data Fig. 2e–g). 

Oln + cells are fated to form bone, not fat

9. Arterioles may be particularly effective at transmitting movement-induced mechanical stimuli from the bone into the marrow because they are thicker and stiffer walled than sinusoids41 and often enter the bone marrow by passing through cortical bone42,43. Mammalian stem–progenitor cell niches thus sometimes require mechanical stimulation for their maintenance.
