# Highlights
As the amount of biological data and its diversity accumulatesmassively there is a critical need to facilitate the integration ofthis data to allow new and unexpected conclusions to be drawnfrom it.The Semantic Web comprises web-based technologies thatallow linking of data between diverse data sets. Semantic Biologyis the application of semantic web technology in the biolog-ical domain (including medical and health informatics).

hese terms are linked by stan-dard relationships, such as “is_a” (an eye “is_a” sense organ) or“part_of” (an eye is “part_of” a head). In this way more detailed(granular) terms can be linked to broader terms, allowing com-putation to be carried out that takes these relationships intoaccount.
