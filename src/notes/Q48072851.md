# Highlights
Further to points raised in your Feature 'The future of biocuration' (Nature 455, 47–50; 2008), an example of the inadequate state of biocuration is to be found in the large number of entries in GenBank listed as “unpublished”. In many cases, a quick online search of journal listings turns up the publication. Obviously, the journals and GenBank are not communicating as well as they ought.

There is also a lack of support for many of those taking time to build up data sets. “I spent lots of time online editing a database” doesn't get you anywhere on a resumé or tenure review, or help an unpaid volunteer make a living.
