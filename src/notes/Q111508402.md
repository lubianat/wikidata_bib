# Highlights


Here we show that human respiratory bronchioles contain a unique secretory cell population that is distinct from cells in larger proximal airways. Organoid modelling reveals that these respiratory airway secretory (RAS) cells act as unidirectional progenitors for alveolar type 2 cells, which are essential for maintaining and regenerating the alveolar niche.

Here we reveal that human respiratory airways are lined with a unique secretory cell population that is distinct from the canonical secretory cells that are primarily found in proximal upper airways, which we term RAS cell


We next used a previously described SCGB3A2–mCherry human embryonic stem (hES) cell reporter line that can generate SCGB3A2+ human airway epithelial cells to assess the relationship between RAS cells and AT2 cells29. We have named these SCGB3A2+ cells induced RAS (iRAS) cells.

Transcriptional regulators enriched in both primary RAS cells and iRAS cells were compared with primary AT2 and iAT2 cells, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). 

Primary RAS cells can give rise to AT2 cells

A recent study also showed that human KDR+HT2-280− airway epithelium can generate AT2 cells, further supporting the idea that a lineage within the human airway epithelium can generate AT2 cells
