# Highlights
We present SciBet, a supervised cell type identifier that accurately predicts cell identity for newly sequenced cells with order-of-magnitude speed advantage.

Finally, we provide both local and web-based SciBet implementations that are compatible with either existing or custom datasets for ultra-fast and accurate cell type identification.

The SciBet algorithm consists of 4 steps: preprocessing, feature selection, model training and cell type assignment (Fig. 1a–d, respectively).

or an unknown cell to be annotated by SciBet, we used its expression profile of the informative genes, and calculated the likelihood function over all multinomial models. SciBet selects the cell type whose model achieves the highest likelihood/prediction power in describing the distribution of the RNA profile. (Fig. 1d and Methods). Each cell in the test set was independently annotated.

 We further built a JavaScript version of SciBet (http://scibet.cancer-pku.cn), which bypasses the process of file uploading to a remote server. Users could use our web server to upload custom reference or test data for cell type prediction. For large query dataset that would take a long time for data transmission, we also provided a lightweight standalone package for local construction of the web-based tools by a simple command. 

Mock” human cell atlas
We integrated 42 human datasets covering the major cell types, which means the canonical and well-characterized cell types previously identified without single cell RNA sequencing data and can be usually mapped to the cell type knowledgebase (e.g., EBI Cell Ontology). For 26 of the 42 datasets, we downloaded raw scRNA-seq fastq files, and estimated the gene-level expression abundance with kallisto23 and human genome reference hg19 (downloaded from UCSC).
