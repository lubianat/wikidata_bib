# Highlights

 The primary aim of biocuration is to extract valuable knowledge from the corpus of available biological data and to accurately represent it in a computable manner so that it may be easy to understand and disseminate. 

 There is even a ‘Research Parasite’ Award [2] for determining the most effective reuse of data

 Tip 1. Know the subject area and assemble a team of experts

 Tip 2. Clearly define the intended use of the curated data

 Curating biological entities, such as functional domains in proteins, is conceptually different from curating metadata of experimental data sets. Second, at which point of the data stream should curation be carried out?

Tip 3. Automate as much curation as possible

Tip 4. Share your data in a standard structure

Before starting a curation task, do a landscape review of what has been done to date to standardise similar data. This will require checking standards indices (for example, in FAIRsharing [https://www.fairsharing.org] [7]), searching the literature, and examining related databases.

Proposing a new ‘standard’ in a field in which well-established and accepted community standards already exist will cause confusion and lead to data interoperability issues. If you feel an existing standard needs improvement, consider contacting the standard’s maintainers and offer to contribute to its design instead. Occasionally, designing new standards is justified because existing standards do not fully describe the data.

Tip 5. Use ontologies and persistent identifiers to annotate your data

Tip 6. Develop robust curation guidelines that include provenance and attribution

Measure intercurator consistency and evolve curation guidelines until consistency reaches a high level (e.g., > 90%–95%). Ontologies can help mitigate cases in which full annotation consistency cannot be achieved [14]. Curation guidelines should be fully documented, versioned, and made available to the users. This aids both curation consistency, transparency, and utility.

Tip 7. Curate early, stay cozy with the data

 Curating early in the data stream also creates a shared sense of stewardship between the curator and the data provider. Through the dialogue, the curator may discover new information that can assist in making the data and their curation more impactful or more interoperable.

Tip 9. Learn basic programming for ad hoc data wrangling

he tips above provide a point of entry for researchers wanting to start contributing to biocuration as part of their projects or in their research area in general. Because of its diverse nature, curation offers great potential for expanding one’s skill set and may benefit careers. The recent introduction of a new postgraduate qualification in biocuration (https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/course/postgraduate-certificate-biocuration) is one step in the right direction in recognising biocuration as a discipline on its own.
