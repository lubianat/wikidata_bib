# Highlights
• Single-cell RNA-seq reveals phenotypic expansion of intratumoral immune cells
• Biscuit identifies cell populations that differ in co-expression patterns

We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. 

Using this approach, we successfully retained information on immune cell activation while stabilizing differences in library size, and uncovered a rich and robust structure in imputed data, suggesting diversity in immune cell subtypes (Figures 2A and 2C).

Our characterization of the immune cell subsets inhabiting primary solid tumor and the corresponding normal tissue, and their heterogeneity within and between patients, revealed continuity of differentiation states and expansions of a “phenotypic space” as principal features of the 2 main cellular targets of cancer immunotherapy: T cells and myeloid cells.
