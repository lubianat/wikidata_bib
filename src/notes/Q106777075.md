# Highlights

Specifically, the investigation of condition-specific functional gene modules (FGM) can help to understand interactive gene networks and complex biological processes in different cell clusters.

We developed an R package named IRIS-FGM (Integrative scRNA-Seq Interpretation System for Functional Gene Module analysis) to support the investigation of FGMs and cell clustering using scRNA-Seq data.

A condition-specific FGM is a highly structured expression pattern of a gene set, which tend to be functionally related or co-regulated in a particular cell cluster or cell type.

We implement the LTMG model using function RunLTMG, and it takes the IRIS-FGM object as input and returns a regulatory signal matrix. The signal matrix can also be integrated into the Seurat object, which can be called by object@LTMG@ Tmp.seurat. 

In the long run, the novel knowledge derived using IRIS-FGM will shed light on the gene regulatory network among various cell types within a complex tissue or disease microenvironment
