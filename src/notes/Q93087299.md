A recipe book for cell types in the human brain
===============================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q93087299]  

# Highlights


Hodge et alpresent a ‘cookbook’ of molecular recipes for the neuronal cell types in the human cerebral cortex. Annotating brain cells under a common taxonomy represents an enormous challenge. Bioinformatic analyses to identify molecular signatures of the major cell classes.

--> Here again the majority concept resurfaces.

Each cell type was given a four-part name on the basis of its general function (excitatory, inhibitory or non-neuronal), its anatomical position, and its expression of genes characteristic of major classes and of specific cell types
