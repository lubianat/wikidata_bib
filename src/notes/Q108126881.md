# Highlights

Here, we review the opportunities and challenges in democratizing datasets, repositories, and community-wide knowledge sharing tools. We present use cases for repurposing open-access immunology datasets with advanced machine learning applications and more.

In 2019, The Google Dataset Search (https://g.co/datasetsearch), a web-based dataset-discovery tool, was built using a crowdsourcing approach for sharing information about data repositories across a broad scope â€“ social science, life science, physics, climate science, and beyond (16). The flexibility in sharing the datasets in flat files, tabular, or any other digital format based on indexing the metadata (data about data) makes it unique.
