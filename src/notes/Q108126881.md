# Highlights

Here, we review the opportunities and challenges in democratizing datasets, repositories, and community-wide knowledge sharing tools. We present use cases for repurposing open-access immunology datasets with advanced machine learning applications and more.

In 2019, The Google Dataset Search (https://g.co/datasetsearch), a web-based dataset-discovery tool, was built using a crowdsourcing approach for sharing information about data repositories across a broad scope â€“ social science, life science, physics, climate science, and beyond (16).
 The flexibility in sharing the datasets in flat files, tabular, or any other digital format based on indexing the metadata (data about data) makes it unique. 

 The HIPC data standards working group leveraged the ontologies to cross-compare cell types and marker(s) expression of each cell type referred as gating definitions in immunophenotyping. They crowdsourced large sets of gating definitions and corresponding cell types from ImmPort studies to examine the ability to parse gating definitions using terms from the Protein Ontology (PRO) and cell type descriptions from Cell Ontology (CL) (24).

 The iReceptor Scientific Gateway links distributed (federated) Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR)-seq repositories provides access to a suite of tools for a complete analysis workflow, including modules for preprocessing and quality control of sequence reads, V(D)J gene segment assignment, repertoire characterization, and repertoire comparison (30).
