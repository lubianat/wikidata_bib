# Highlights
Conclusions Literature-based discovery tools generate specific patterns of associations between psychiatric and somatic diseases: one subset was appraised as promising for further research; the other subset surprised the experts, leading to intricate discussions and further eliciting of frameworks of biomedical knowledge. 

We decided to investigate whether LBD is useful in assessing the association between diseases in an interdisciplinary study on the co-occurrence of psychiatric and somatic disorders, their physical and psychosocial determinants, as well as their medical and social consequences.

In this study Anni, an LBD tool developed by the Erasmus Medical Center, which provides an ontology-based interface to Medline, was used.42 Anni uses three sources: (1) an ontology composed of the 2006AC version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) using Aronson's adaptation of the ULMS Metathesaurus for efficient natural language processing,43 and a gene thesaurus derived from various databases, for example, the NCBI's Homologene database44;
