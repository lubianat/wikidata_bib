# Highlights
We  profiled,at  the  single-cell  level,the  transcriptome  of  themodel  organism cynomolgus 133monkey(Macaca  fascicularis)

thick  ascending  limbcells

--> I did not know that one :) 

he  kidney  consisted  of  11  clusters,  those  being  podocytes,  thick  ascending  limbcells,168proximal  tubulecells,  intercalated  cells 1and  2,  connecting  tubule cells,  distal  convoluted 169tubule cells, stomal cells, thin limb cells, principal cellsand endothelial cells

--> Good set of kidney cells

In conclusion, we have successfully profiledthe transcriptomeofnineorgansat single-190cell resolutionin monkey,which could assist in the study of COVID-19

--> Why COVID-19?? That is super artificial, and not really necessary. Hype surfing.

--> I get the "timely issue", but the focus on ACE2 + TMPRSS2 expression is so overwhelming, everywhere
