# Highlights

A time-consuming challenge faced by camera trap practitioners is the extraction of meaningful data from images to inform ecological management. An increasingly popular solution is automated image classification software.

We present a method ecologists can use to develop optimized location invariant camera trap object detectors by (a) evaluating publicly available image datasets characterized by high intradataset variability in training deep learning models for camera trap object detection and (b) using small subsets of camera trap images to optimize models for high accuracy domain-specific applications.

The datasets used in this study were collated using images from FlickR and iNaturalist. We also used camera trap image datasets obtained from www.lila.science i

We also developed a Python script to download images from iNaturalist using a csv file containing URLs of relevant observations downloaded from inaturalist.org.

The Australian pig dataset (AU_pig) is a custom dataset, obtained during feral pig trapping and control operations. More information about each dataset is provided in Table 3, and a subset is shown in Figure 2.
