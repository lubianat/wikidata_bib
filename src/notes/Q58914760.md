# Highlights

Here, we introduce a third approach, GoWeb, which combines
classical keyword-based Web search with text-mining and ontologies to
navigate large results sets and facilitate question answering.

All of the above standards serve the need to formally represent knowledge
and facilitate reasoning over this knowledge. They require explicit statements
of knowledge. As a consequence, the amount of such structured data is still
small in comparison to the unstructured data


The third benchmark for GoWeb is based on the questions from the
TREC Genomics Track 2006[36]. The results of TREC Genomics Track 2006
comprise a benchmark that focused on passage retrieval for question answering.
It is based on full-text documents from the biomedical literature. For the year
2006 there were 28 questions. With GoWeb one can answer 22 of these 28 questions (78,6%). In 13 of these cases the semantic filter helped to reduce the result
set. For a summary of all questions please have a look at Table 3.
