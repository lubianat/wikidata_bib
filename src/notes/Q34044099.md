  [@wikidata:Q34044099]  

# Highlights

We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes. 

Our knowledge of cellular diversity is incomplete; for example, the cell-type complexity of the brain is unknown and widely debated

Wethen applied it to a complex neural tissue, mouse retina, and from 44,808 cell profiles identified 39 distinct populations, each corresponding to one or a group of closely related cell types.
