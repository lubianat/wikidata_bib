PRINTS and its automatic supplement, prePRINTS.
===============================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q34169535]  

# Highlights
Fingerprints are groups of conserved sequence motifs that together provide diagnostic signatures for protein families
They derive much of their potency from the context afforded by multiple-motif matching, making them more flexible and powerful than single-motif approaches. 

The growth of PRINTS is limited by the fact that it is maintained entirely manually, and hence it lags behind databases that are produced automatically.

We, therefore, developed an automatic supplement to PRINTS, termed prePRINTS (http:// www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/prePRINTS/)

Oops, I thought it was about preprints.
