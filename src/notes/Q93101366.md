# Highlights
. In this article we propose an approach using Machine Learning (ML) to facilitate parts of this task by training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with actions taken during manual biocuration

here are many tools, such asMINERVA [2], Newt [3] and CellDesigner [4], which provideexpert biologists with visualizations of such biological net-works, often referred to as maps.

 By duplicating the right nodes, thegraph  can  be  transformed  by  the  curator  to  produce  amore  readable  layout  with  less  edge  crossings,  and  lessedge  routing.  On  the  other  hand,  if  a  pathway  containsmany duplicated nodes it also hampers the understandingof linked processes and some cloned nodes may need to bemerged  (de-duplicated). 

Fig. 2. A simple example showing the impact of node duplication.

--> Good figure, made the point 

This  maphas been rearranged into a modular layout, which reducededge  crossings,  decreased  its  mean  network  distance  and,due to node duplication, increased the number of elements(see [11] for more details)
To  validate  the  approach  on  a  broader  set  of  graphs,  themethod is applied to a selected set of Reactome pathways.The Reactome database contains a wide range of small andlarge  pathway  graphs. 

Before  starting  they  were  introduced  to  the  concept  andimplications of node duplication and asked about their priorknowledge in the topic of biological pathway graphs with a5-point Likert scale [39]:1)None, I donâ€™t know what it is,2)I have seen biological pathways,3)Some, I have read biological pathways,4)I have used pathways professionally,5)Expert, I have edited and curated pathways

To  support  the  curation  and  layout  of  large  biologicalpathways  we  focus  on  the  technique  of  node  duplication,i.e.  splitting  or  cloning  a  node  to  bring  a  graph  closer  toa  planar  structure,  with  the  goal  of  producing  a  layoutwith  less  edge-crossings.
