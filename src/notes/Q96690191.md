# Highlights

ScRNA-seq has pushed the science of the digestive system forward by characterizing the function of distinct cell types within complex intestinal cellular environments, by illuminating the heterogeneity within specific cell populations and by identifying novel cell types in the human gut that could contribute to a variety of intestinal diseases.

BEST4+ cells are a previously unknown source of the paracrine hormone uroguanylin, which regulates intestinal electrolyte homeostasis by binding to the guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) receptor and, thereby, increases intracellular levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 

Thus, Th17 cell subtypes are ranging from classic Th17 CD4+ T cells, which have an inflammation-modulating phenotype and appear to share a lineage with Treg cells, to the Th17-like cells, with a cytotoxic phenotype, on the other end of the spectrum. The latter are a mixed population of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. ScRNA-seq detected the marked expansion of this population in the gut mucosa in both IBD and CRC, and it seems to play an important role in aggravating tissue damage and subsequent cancer progression (10,12,13).
