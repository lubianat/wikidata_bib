# Highlights

The Wikidata knowledge base (KB) is one of the most popularstructured data repositories on the web, containing more than 1billion statements for over 90 million entities. Like most major KBs,it is nonetheless incomplete and therefore operates under the open-world assumption (OWA)

We review a statistical inference method for negative statements,calledpeer-based inference, and presentWikinegata, a platformthat implements this inference over Wikidata.

These KBs contain almost onlypositivestate-ments, and this is engraved in theopen-world assumption(OWA)employed on theSemantic Web, which states that asserted state-ments aretrue, while the remainder isunknown.

“Hawking has won the Nobel Prize in Physics”is absent and thusconsideredunknown. In reality, the reason for the absence of thelatter statement is itsfalseness. Being able to formally distinguishwhether a statement is false, and asserting its falseness, would en-hance Wikidata’s ability to display more relevant knowledge inentity summarization.

 Nevertheless, Wikidata’s ability to express somekinds of negation is a notable exception among major KBs, whichwe discuss in more details in Section 2.

n this paper, we revisit the core of thepeer-based inferencemethod, published in [1], to derive negative statements that are bothrelevantand likelycorrect.

 Consider the entityBill Gates. We notice thatmany entities similar to him (e.g.,Eric SchmidtorTony Fadell) dohave an academic degree. For this reason, assumingcompletenesswithin a group of related entitiesis reasonable to draw for thisproperty ofGates, namely that he truly holds no academic degree.

 At the same time,Gates’s peers could also share other information,such as that many of them have relatives. To avoid that negations f such incidental information comes first, thepeer-based inferenceincorporate, on top of collecting peers and inferring candidatenegative statements, additionalranking features, such as frequency,unexpectedness, etc., tuned using a supervised regression model.Further details are in Section 3.

Wikidata is a free crowd-sourced KB with more than 25k activeusers and 329 bots. It contains more than a billion statement about92 million entities.

Deleted Statements.Having access to the history of edits inWikidata may offer promising candidates for negative informa-tion [31], namely by investigating the statements that were oncepart of a KB but got subsequently deleted (possible candidate forgrounded negative statements)

On a random sample of 1kdeleted statements, over 82% were just caused by ontology modifi-cations, granularity changes, rewordings, or prefix modifications,such as:(Ghandi; lifestyle; Vegetarian)changed toVegetarian-ismand(James Green; oxfordID; 101011386)changed to11386.15% were statements that were actually restored a year later, andthe remaining 3% represented actual negation, yet we found them tobe rarelynoteworthy, i.e., presenting mostly things like correctionsof birth dates or location updates reflecting geopolitical changes.

One way of expressing negation is via countsmatching with instances. For example,Joe Bidenhas 4 childrenlisted for the propertychild, as well as the statement(number ofchildren; 4). This allows the conclusion that anyone else isnothischild. Yet while such count predicates exist in popular KBs, none ofthem has a formal way of dealing with these

.Erroneous changes can also be di-rectly recorded via the deprecated rank feature [18], asgroundednegative statements. However, we found that this mostly relatesto errors coming from various import sources, and its focus isnot mainly materializinginterestingnegations like that“StephenHawking did not win the Nobel Prize in Physics.”.

Wikidata contains predicates that carry anegative meaning, for instance,does not have part,does nothave quality, anddifferent from. Yet these present very specificpieces of knowledge, e.g.,(public statement; does not have qual-ity; confidentiality)and(death; different from; brain death), anddo not generalize to other properties. Although there have beendiscussions to extend the Wikidata data model to allow genericproperty negations3, these have not been worked out so far

No-Values.Wikidata can capture statements aboutuniversal ab-sencevia the “no-value” symbol [9]. This allows KB editors to add astatement with an empty object. For example, what we express as¬∃𝑥(Angela Merkel; child;𝑥), Wikidata allows to be expressed as(Angela Merkel; child; no-value)4. There exist 122k of such “no-value” statements, yet only used in narrow domains.  For instance,53% of these statements come for just two propertiescountry(usedalmost exclusively for geographic features in Antarctica), andfol-lows(indicating that an artwork is not a sequel).


Research Problem.Given an entity𝑒, compile a ranked list ofinterestinggrounded negative and universally negative statements.

Due to real-world changes or KB completions,some of the precomputed negative statements may become incor-rect. For example,Brad Pitthas won hisfirstOscarin 2020. Soup until 2020, the statement¬(Brad Pitt; award; Oscar)was valid.We therefore perform a real-time validation using the WikidataSPARQL endpoint to check that a statement is not contained inWikidata at interaction time

We addressed the notion ofinterestingnessof negative knowledge. What is noteworthy? Andhow can we discover it? There are more than 5.5k awards that anactorcanwin in Wikidata5, andTom Cruisedidnotwin 99.99% ofthem. But one salient award that is relevant to add is theOscarthat he didnotreceive yet.


Hierarchical  checks  (usingsubclass ofandinstance of),such as dropping“Hawking is not aphysicist”because he isatheoretical physicist. Or dropping the statement¬(DouglasAdams; occupation; author)because he is awriter. Thesame goes for awards (Academy Award) and instances ofawards (Academy Award for Best Actor,Best Actress, etc.)

 Due to the lack of positive informationabout them, most of the inferred negations are merely missinginformation. We are also interested in deployingWikinegatainsideWikidata to make it more accessible to its community.
