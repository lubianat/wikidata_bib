# Highlights
Brain metastasis (br-met) develops in an immunologically unique br-met niche. Central nervous system-native myeloid cells (CNS-myeloids) and bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMDMs) cooperatively regulate brain immunity

Using a human br-met tissue array (Table S1), we observed hypertrophic Iba1+ myeloid cells surrounded and infiltrated human br-mets regardless of primary tumor origin

Iba1+ br-met-associated myeloid cells (Br.MAM)

Myeloid Cells Infiltrate Br-mets and Are a Prominent, Diverse Component of the Br-mets Niche

We next examined how br-mets altered the brain immune landscape by mass cytometry (CyTOF). t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) showed a contrast in surface-marker expression between the naive brain and br-met

We further subsetted BMDMs into three broad canonically related categories for further analysis: Ly6CHi inflammatory monocytes, Ly6CLo patrolling monocytes, and neutrophils (Figures S3Câ€“S3E).
