# Highlights

But if the same species
lives in a warm, dry region, its leaves are more
likely to be smaller and smoother.
Now, an atlas that traces the shapes of
182,000 leaves from 141 plant families in
75 locations around the world shows promise for refining scientists’ ability to read that
story

“We’re getting closer and closer to
automating measures of leaf shape, and using
that to figure out the taxonomy of a plant and
reconstruct climate.
