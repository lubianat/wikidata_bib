# Highlights

While existing text annotation tools may provide user-friendly interfaces to domain experts, limited support is available for figure display, project management, and multi-user team annotation. In response, we developed TeamTat (https://www.teamtat.org), a web-based annotation tool (local setup available), equipped to manage team annotation projects engagingly and efficiently


Neves and Leser (9), and Neves and Seva (10) have recently provided extensive reviews for automatic annotation tools (11–22) and, as a result of their analysis, they identify a list of criteria that maximize a tool's use for annotation/curation of gold standard corpora. These criteria are: (i) technical – users prefer tools that are publicly available, web-based and open source, with an option for local installation to allow for the secure annotation of documents such as clinical records, (ii) data – users prefer that tools handle the standard formats for input/output of documents and annotations and can be easily applied to PubMed, (iii) functional – users prefer tools that handle multi-label annotations, document-level annotations, relational annotations, full text annotations, as well as multiple-user and team annotations. In addition, the ideal tool should allow multiple languages, support links to ontologies and terminologies, and provide for quality assessment and inter-annotator agreement calculations. Finally, the authors evaluate a tool's suitability for biomedicine by its ability to support the integration with PubMed or PMC (23), as this facilitates the retrieval, parsing, and even pre-processing of documents for corpus annotation.

TeamTat features (i) full-text support showing the document in its entirety including figures as they are an integral part of manual biomedical annotation/curation; (ii) easy integration with PubMed and PMC through BioC (24), a simple format for sharing text data and annotations towards improved interoperability created by the text mining research community; (iii) an intuitive and user-friendly interface for all users to review and analyse their annotations, independently and collaboratively and (iv) a quality assessment and management mechanism to bring this all together from a project administration perspective

The important features of the annotation interface in TeamTat include: (i) annotators may collaborate, (ii) annotators can annotate documents of any length, including full text journal articles, (iii) the TeamTat interface can display all figures of PubMed Central full text articles, (iv) documents can be added from the PubMed/PMC BioC APIs (24,25), or uploaded from local repositories, (v) the annotation interface is optimized for user-friendly browsing, (vi) documents can be annotated for triage, for entities and for relations.

TeamTat was designed to include useful features from ezTag, PubTator Central, and Marky (15,16,32). As such, TeamTat offers an improved smart interface, full text support, and relation annotation.

TeamTat ensures that entity types selected by the user are consistent with the annotation schema defined by the project manager. Moreover, TeamTat relations are not restricted to binary relations. They can have up to eight components, and they are at the document level, meaning that individual nodes are not restricted to appear in the same sentence, or even in the same paragraph


TeamTat has been used for the development of two recent corpora at the National Library of Medicine, the NLM-Chem corpus, a collection of 150 full text articles annotated for chemicals, and the NLM-Gene corpus, a collection of 550 PubMed articles annotated for genes from 11 model organism


TeamTat has been active since March 2019 for team annotation projects at NLM, and word-of-mouth has generated a large active base of more than a hundred document annotators
