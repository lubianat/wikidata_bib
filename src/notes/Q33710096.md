# Highlights
We hypothesize that the same cells of a normal pituitary gland releases several hormones simultaneously.

We found that the same cells of the normal adenohypophysis can co-express prolactin with ACTH, TSH, FSH, LH; GH with ACTH, TSH, FSH, LH, and TSH with ACTH, FSH, LH. 

e pituitary gland develops from 2 of different origin: an upward invagination in the roof of the primitive oral cavity (Rathke’s pouch) and an evagination from the floor of the third ventricle (pituitary stalk)

The pituitary gland develops from 2 of different origin: an upward invagination in the roof of the primitive oral cavity (Rathke’s pouch) and an evagination from the floor of the third ventricle (pituitary stalk)

There are 5 types of cells in the adenohypophysis: somatotrophs, prolactin cells, corticotropic cells, thyrotropic cells and gonadotropic ones
