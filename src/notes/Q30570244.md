# Highlights

Semantic integration enables the assignment of unambiguous meanings to data shared among different applications in an integrated environment, allowing the exchange of data in a semantically consistent and meaningful way. This work aims at developing an ontology-based methodology for the semantic integration of gene expression analysis tools.

: The proposed methodology facilitates the development of connectors capable of semantically integrating different gene expression analysis tools and data sources.

In most cases biologists have to use different, isolated ana- lysis tools. In those cases, biologists must frequently implement themselves, without proper guidelines, the necessary code to integrate those tools, which can hin- der effective research [18]. 

we can identify two general ontol- ogy-based approaches for the integration of bioinformatics systems and databases [27]. In the first approach, ontolo- gies have been used as source for the design of a common or reference (database) model shared by a number of related tools or databases (e.g., [20,28-32]). In the second approach, ontologies have been used as basis for the devel- opment of mediators, i.e., software entities that encom- passes a global knowledge (global database schema) and, at the same time, are able to provide mappings to the spe- cific (local) schemas to be integrated (e.g., [33-36])

Software connectors represent architectural elements used to model interactions among either computation or data compo- nents of a system.

Software architecture emmerged as a sub-discipline of software engeneering in the early 90â€™s. This discipline is focused, among others, on the architecture description of complex systems and on the use of this description as basis for system design, development, reuse and man- agement in general [37].

A connector can be as sim- ple as a global variable (shared memory) or procedure call or as complex as a P2P-based data distribution.

The class gene expression value represents a value obtained by quantifying the functional products produced by a gene as a result of its expression (relationship quantifies).

The complete OWL specification of the Gene Expression Ontology, including the definition of a SAGE experi- mental process, can be found in a supplementary material.

We applied the proposed methodology in the develop- ment of three integration scenarios for the analysis of different types of gene expression data

We have developed an ontology-based methodology for the semantic integration of gene expression analysis tools and data sources using software connectors.

In many occasions, inte- gration is carried out by someone with insufficient knowledge of the target domain. Even if a domain expert is available, the absence of a systematic approach towards integration favours the arising of (semantical) inconsis- tencies because integration is based only on tacit knowl- edge. Our methodology enforces the use of explicit knowledge, since conceptual models must be developed to represent input and output data items.
