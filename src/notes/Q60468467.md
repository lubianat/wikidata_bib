# Highlights
 This technology raises the possibility
of identifying the molecular trajectories that
describe cell fate specification by sampling
densely during embryogenesis and connecting
the transcriptomes of cells that have similar gene
expression profiles.

We generated single-cell transcrip-
tomes from 38,731 cells during early zebrafish
embryogenesis at high temporal resolution,
spanning 12 stages from the onset of zygotic
transcription through early somitogenesis

There-
fore, we developed URD, an approach to uncover
complex developmental trajectories as a branch-
ing tree. URD extends diffusion maps [originally
presented for single-cell differentiation analysis
in pioneering work by Haghverdi et al. and their 
R package, destiny (9, 10)] through several ad-
vances: It introduces a new way to order cells in
pseudotime, finds developmental trajectories, dis-
covers an underlying branching tree that abstracts
specification, and visualizes the data (Fig. 1D and
supplementary materials, materials and methods).

For example, consistent
with its known expression, the notochord marker
gene noto was restricted primarily to two tra-
jectories (the entire notochord trajectory and
the later stages of the tailbud trajectory) 

Collectively, our approach provides a frame-
work with which to reconstruct the specification
trajectories of many developmental systems with-
out the need for prior knowledge of gene ex-
pression patterns, fate maps, or lineage trajectories.
The generation of developmental trees for dif-
ferent species will enable comparative studies,
and developmental statistics generated from such
comparisons will help reveal conserved pathways
and species-specific idiosyncracies
