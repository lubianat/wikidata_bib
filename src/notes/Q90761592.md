# Highlights

Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) transmit sound information from cochlear hair cells to the CNS. Using transcriptome analysis of thousands of single neurons, we demonstrate that murine type I SGNs consist of subclasses that are defined by the expression of subsets of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, and neurotransmitter receptors.

To molecularly profile SGNs, we carried out massively parallel scRNA-seq experiments with cells obtained from the inner ears of 9-week-old, male CBA/CaJ mice

Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of the gene expression program of SGNs, identify molecularly distinct SGN subtypes, and demonstrate that activity-dependent mechanisms are critical for SGN subtype specification.
