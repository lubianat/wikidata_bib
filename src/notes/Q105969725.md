# Highlights

To accelerate knowledge capture andcommunication and to keep pace with the rapid growth of scientific reports, we developedthe Biofactoid (biofactoid.org) software suite, which crowdsources structured knowledge inarticles from authors. 


We envision the adoption ofBiofactoid for crowdsourced curation by scientists and publishers as part of an ecosystem oftools that accelerate scientific communication and discovery


For reasons of efficiency and accuracy, structured knowledge of biomedicaldiscoveries could be provided directly by the original authors of research reports, rather thanpost-hoc, through the curation efforts of knowledge base teams.

1.1.3. Interoperable publication processes: nanopublications

Phase III measured engagement rate by emailing 260 authors who publishedselected articles across 16 journals. Roughly 8.5% of these authors successfully shared theirresearch in Biofactoid, proving that many authors can and will use Biofactoid (Figure 2A).

The computableknowledge capture model proposed here includes formal knowledge representation usingontologies, easy to use curation support software that links molecules to correspondingdatabase identifiers (normalization), submission to widely available knowledge resources, aconnection with the publication process and author attribution

--> Simplified, but a  nice way forward, I guess. Let's see how it scales.
