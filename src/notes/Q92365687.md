# Highlights

 Here we show that intravenous 
administration of BCG profoundly alters the protective outcome of Mtb challenge in 
non-human primates (Macaca mulatta). Compared with intradermal or aerosol 
delivery, intravenous immunization induced substantially more antigen-responsive 
CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in blood, spleen, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung 
lymph nodes.


tradermal and intramuscular administration—the most 
common routes of vaccine administration—do not induce high frequen-
cies of resident memory T (TRM) cells in the lung. Studies performed 
50 years ago suggested that administration of BCG by aerosol (AE) or 
intravenous (IV) routes enhanced protection in non-human primates 
(NHPs) challenged shortly after immunization5–8. However, there 
remains a limited understanding for mechanisms by which dose and 
route of BCG influence systemic and tissue-specific T cell immunity, and 
whether optimizing these variables would lead to high-level prevention 
of Mtb infection and disease. We hypothesized that a sufficiently high 
dose of IV BCG would elicit a high frequency of systemic and tissue 
resident T cells mediating durable protection against Mtb infection 
and disease in highly susceptible rhesus macaques.


Our data are con-
sistent with studies in mice that demonstrate the superior capacity of 
lung-localized TRM cells to control TB disease36,37, and studies in NHPs 
showing that depletion of lung interstitial CD4 T cells during SIV infec-
tion of Mtb latently infected NHPs is associated with reactivation and 
dissemination3
