# Highlights

We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify markers, spatial localization, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices shows DAM with intracellular/phagocytic Aβ particles. Single-cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (Trem2)−/− Tg-AD reveals that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process.

In order to enrich for the rare DAM cells over other immune populations, we used the single-cell data to identify potential markers. We identified CD9, Itgax (CD11c), Clec7a, and CD63 as potential DAM markers (Figure 1E; Table S2) and sorted 1,358 CD11c+ microglia from the different time points along disease progression (Figure S2A).

A similar intermediate DAM state is observed in the Trem2+/+5XFAD at a smaller frequency (Figure 5E), but unlike in the Trem2−/− background, most cells proceed and activate the full DAM program (Figures 5B, 5D, and S5). This analysis suggests that DAM are generated through a two-step mechanism of activation of homeostatic microglia (Figure 6).
