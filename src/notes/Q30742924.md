# Highlights
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have resulted in petabytes of scattered data,
decentralized in archives, databases and sometimes in isolated hard-disks which are inaccessible for browsing and
analysis. It is expected that curated secondary databases will help organize some of this Big Data thereby allowing
users better navigate, search and compute on it.

proof-of-concept, we have curated and analyzed control
and case breast cancer datasets from the NCI cancer genomics program - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

TCGA data is expected to surpass 100 petabytes
by the completion of the project. 
 We chose to curate
publicly available NGS data to provide users an unbiased
view of variation that is present at the individual person
level and is not yet completely captured in dbSNP, thereby
providing a better understanding of the human variome.

There is a great need in biological research and discovery for curated metadata that is associated with short sequence reads. Just like GenBank, NCBI-SRA and other
public repository of short sequence reads around the
world are all primary databases with minimal or no curation. This means that it is extremely difficult for users
to search for and retrieve studies that can be used for
additional analysis or browse analysis results that are associated with specific genes of interest
