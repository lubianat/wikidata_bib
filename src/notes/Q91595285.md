Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT), integrating genotyping 
with high-throughput droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq. We applied GoT to study how somatic 
mutations corrupt the complex process of human hematopoiesis, profiling 38,290 CD34+ cells 
from patients with CALR-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).


We further extended the GoT toolkit to genotype multiple targets and loci distant from transcript ends. Collectively, these 
findings revealed that the transcriptional output of MPN somatic mutations is dependent on the 
native cell identity.


 We applied GoT to CD34+ cells from MPN patients, which revealed that MPN mutations in 
hematopoietic progenitor cells do not lead to uniform transcriptional outputs, but rather 
show strong dependence on progenitor subset identity


Here, we present GoT, which co-captures somatic genotypes and transcriptomic identities in 
thousands of single cells from primary cancer specimens


Briefly, targeted enrichment of 45 genes recurrently mutated in myeloid malignancies was performed 
using the Thunderstorm system.
