# Highlights

We validated the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic RNAs. We profiled 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system’s ability to characterize large immune populations. 

The core of the technology is a Gel bead in EMulsion (GEM). GEM generation takes place in an 8-channel microfluidic chip that encapsulates single gel beads at ∼80% fill rate 

To determine the effect that a freeze-thaw might have on gene expression and thus on the ability of our scRNA-seq pipeline to classify cell type in frozen repository specimens, we froze the remaining fresh PBMCs from Donor A, and made a scRNA-seq library from gently thawed cells 3 weeks later where ∼3k cells were recovered

Here we present a droplet-based scRNA-seq technology that enables encapsulation of tens of thousands of single cells within minutes.
