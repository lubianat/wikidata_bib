# Highlights

Here, we describe MyGene.info and MyVariant.info, high-performance web services for querying gene andvariant annotation information. These web services are currently accessed more than three million times permonth.

. Previously observed variants indbSNP129 [18], the 1000 Genomes Project [19], orHapMap were  excluded. PolyPhen  predictions [20]were used to prioritize variants that were predicted tobe  damaging.  This  process  undoubtedly  involveddownloading, parsing, and analyzing annotation datafrom multiple databases, representing a significant in-vestment of time and effort.Using the MyGene.info and MyVariant.info R packagesalone, we are able to implement an updated version of thispipeline: about 50 lines of code, requiring no local installa-tion of variant annotation databases or software tools (seeFig. 2, [21], and Additional file 2: Supplementary Note 1).

--> Nice
 
 We have implementedthe initial versions of our easy-to-use query interfacefor both APIs: http://mygene.info/demo and http://myvariant.info/demo. They can be easily accessed fromeach siteâ€™s landing page.

 --> I think this has evolved into the Biothings API
