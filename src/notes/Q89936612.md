# Highlights

. Here, we built comprehensive single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic atlases across various rat tissues undergoing aging and CR. CR attenuated aging-related changes in cell type composition, gene expression, and core transcriptional regulatory networks.

We systematically analyzed more than 210,000 single cells and nuclei across nine types of tissues sampled from young and old rats subjected to ad libitum (AL) feeding, and old rats subjected to CR beginning in middle adulthood.

Of these cell types, more than 20 were tissue-specific, such as Cyp2e1+ hepatocytes in the liver and Pdgfra+ adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in adipose tissue. In contrast, Pecam1+ endothelial cells (ECs) and Lum+ fibroblasts were present in most tissues, including BAT, WAT, aorta, skin, and liver (Figure 1E).
