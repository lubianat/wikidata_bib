# Highlights

In the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) consortium, equity has been a point of emphasis from inception in 2016 for one simple reason: the HCA’s success depends upon it. Fundamentally, the HCA is meant to be a foundational resource, inclusive of the many cell types and states found in healthy people across the globe

--> Equity and the HCA; 1.4. The challenges of the Human Cell Atlas

1. Trust must be given and earned
For the HCA to be representative of the people, it must be erected by the people

2. Ask questions and listen carefully
3. Inequity can be driven by lack of knowledge

Often, information, approaches and initiatives assumed to be common knowledge are, in fact, not. The HCA, illustratively, is anchored on concepts and methods that are at the frontier of basic science, having been realized in the past five years or so. The specific background required for a deep understanding of these approaches, as well as the initial scientific results being derived by the laboratories engaged in the HCA (which are located mostly in high-income countries; the global north), may not be readily available in low- and middle-income countries (the global south).

To begin to determine how to help build this knowledge base, we held the first HCA Equity Roadshow at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, in September 2019, to introduce members of the Brazilian scientific community to the HCA and to explore potential intersections between the HCA and local research priorities


One straightforward strategy to facilitate local empowerment is to identify, partner with and fortify existing local infrastructure in regions underrepresented in the HCA, such as the West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens in Ghana or the Child Health Research Foundation in Bangladesh.
