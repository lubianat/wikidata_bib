# Highlights
A new method for profiling the perturbation and transcriptome in the same cell
â€¢
An integrated approach for CRISPR-pooled screens with single-cell transcriptomics

We applied CRISP-seq to probe regulatory circuits of innate immunity. By sampling tens of thousands of perturbed cells in vitro and in mice, 

We applied CRISP-seq to characterize the regulatory network controlling the differentiation of myeloid cells and their response to pathogen components by measuring tens of thousands of single cells perturbed for critical developmental and immune response regulators. 

 Then 5 days later, infected GFP+BFP+/mCherry+CD11c+ myeloid-derived cells were sorted for massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq analysis (STAR Methods; Key Resources Table). Information
