# Highlights

An important SNOMED CT use case is to support semantic
interoperability between electronic health records and aggregation terminologies
such as ICD.

Recently the EU-funded support action ASSESS-CT [1] has highlighted the need to
distinguish between the following three types of terminology artefacts:
1. User interface terminologies (lists of popular domain terms)
2. Reference terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT)
3. Aggregation terminologies (e.g., ICD)

However, it is not trivial to understand the roles of these terminology types and how they
are related to basic distinctions in knowledge representation such as “open world” or
“closed world” semantics [2]

Terminology – in which its representational units are interpreted as concepts (entities 
of lexical meaning), related to human language terms of different types (Fully
Specified Names, Preferred Terms, and Synonyms), obeying certain naming
conventions and:
 Ontology – in which its representational units are interpreted as classes, individuals
(a few) and formal relations, as building blocks for logical expressions in the
description logic EL++/OWL-EL, which are compatible with expressions in
SNOMED CT’s CG (Compositional Grammar) [4]

We here propose to assess how the indiscriminate use of SNOMED CT synonyms
can hamper the quality of the formal concept model’s logical expressions.

-->- 1.2.2. Computational ontologies and their methods

It is important to include SNOMED CT synonyms (interface terms) as well as fully
specified names (standardised labels) in any effort using lexical methods for integrating
SNOMED CT with other terminologies and value sets.
The differences between ambiguous clinical language as expressed by synonyms
and formal meaning representation as expressed by SNOMED CT concept model are a
risk to be taken into account.
