Wikidata as a linked-data hub for Biodiversity data

# Highlights

To convert between these different formats, bots need to be developed that are able to parse the different resources and serialize into wikidata. We have developed a software library in the Python programming language, which we use to build these bots. Once created, these bots run regularly to keep Wikidata up-to-date with knowledge on genes, proteins, diseases and drugs.

The latter we leverage as a feature in our bots. One of our core resources is, for example, the Disease Ontology (Schriml et al. 2018). This ontology on human diseases is continuously updated by its curation team. 2 times per month, updates are then synchronised with Wikidata.

Although our bots focus on molecular biology, our approaches are generic in onset that we are confident a similar approach can work in biodiversity informatics
