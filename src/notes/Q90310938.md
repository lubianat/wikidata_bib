# Highlights

Within solid tumors, why monocytes preferentially differentiate into immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) rather than immunostimulatory dendritic cells (DCs) remains unclear. Using multiple murine sarcoma models, we find that the TME induces tumor cells to produce retinoic acid (RA), which polarizes intratumoral monocyte differentiation toward TAMs and away from DCs via suppression of DC-promoting transcription factor Irf4.

Similarly, although RA can induce Foxp3+ T regulatory cells and Arg1 producing anti-inflammatory macrophages, it has also been reported to promote anti-tumor Th1 or Th17 T cell responses and dampen myeloid-derived suppressor cell function (Bhatt et al., 2014, Bhattacharya et al., 2016, Hill et al., 2008, Nefedova et al., 2007, Vellozo et al., 2017)

Taken together, these findings suggest that TME-associated factors promote monocyte differentiation into suppressive TAMs but not DCs.

To assess whether Aldh fluorescence is truly indicative of Raldh activity, we performed gene expression profiling on sorted Aldh+ and Aldhâˆ’ tumor cells.
