# Highlights

Here we study wound fibroblast diversity using single-cell RNA-sequencing. On analysis, wound fibroblasts group into twelve clusters. Pseudotime and RNA velocity analyses reveal that some clusters likely represent consecutive differentiation states toward a contractile phenotype, while others appear to represent distinct fibroblast lineages.

All fibroblasts shared the following 20 TFs: Cebpb, Egr1, Fosb, Fosl2, Hif1a, Klf2, Klf4, Klf6, Klf9, Nfat5, Nfatc1, Nfkb1, Nr4a1, Nr4a2, Pbx1, Prrx1, Runx1, Stat3, Tcf4, and Zeb2 (Supplementary Figure 7a). These can be defined as a common wound fibroblast TF signature


otably, PDGFRA signaling is an established driver of fibrosis in multiple tissues, including fat and skeletal muscle. Pdgfrahigh cells also express higher levels of receptors for the TGFÎ² pathway, another well-established driver of fibrosis. Pdgfralow cells are also Pdgfrbhigh, and Pdgfrb-expressing perivascular cells were identified as the precursors for new adipocytes in visceral fat in obesity
