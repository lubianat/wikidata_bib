# Highlights

So it might sound like a truism that researchers should conscientiously handle, preserve and — where appropriate — share the data they generate and use. The problem is that this can be hard to do.

The message must now be passed on to scientists who work in fields less familiar with big data. Many of these, at all career stages, are worryingly unprepared.

The laudable move towards open science — under which data are shared — makes the need for good data management more pressing than ever: there’s no point in sharing data if they aren’t clean and annotated enough to be reused. If you haven’t got a plan for your data, you need one now.
