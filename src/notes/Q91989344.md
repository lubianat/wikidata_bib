# Highlights
• COPD lung is dominated by three pathogenic stem cell variants
• These variants are epigenetically committed to metaplastic lesions found in COPD

Consistent with this notion, squamous cell metaplasia (SCM) and goblet cell metaplasia (GCM) typically observed in COPD likewise are not fully abolished by smoking cessation (Hogg and Timens, 2009, Lapperre et al., 2007, Raju et al., 2016, Zhou-Suckow et al., 2017). This persistence was surprising, as metaplasia has been tied to acute effects of cigarette smoke and inflammatory cytokines on normal airway progenitors (Araya et al., 2007, Schamberger et al., 2015, Wills-Karp et al., 1998). 

cluster 4 clones in particular constitutively express a broad array of genes related to inflammation and are denoted herein as ‘inflammatory SCM’ or ‘iSCM’ versus ‘SCM’ for cluster 3 clones.

Importantly, the respective differentiation fates of these clone types in xenografts proved to be remarkably stable to 250 days of continuous propagation in vitro, suggesting that these metaplasia are the consequences of highly stable, cell-autonomous fate programs (Figure 2E). 

These data link the two SCMs produced by clusters 3 and 4 clones, but not GCM or normal airway epithelia, to the accumulation of myofibroblasts

The overall findings here set the stage for more detailed studies of correlations between the abundance of such clones and COPD stage as well as their correlation with the known regional, intrapulmonary variations in COPD pathology (Nambu et al., 2016).
