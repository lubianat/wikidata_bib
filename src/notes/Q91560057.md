# Highlights

To study the heterogeneity of microglia at a single-cell level during different homeostatic conditions, we analysed single microglial cells from multiple anatomical regions of the embryonic (embryonic day (E)16.5), juvenile (3 weeks) and adult (16 weeks) mouse CNS (Extended Data Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1).

Likewise, the postnatal clusters showed a variable distribution both spatially and temporally; for example, C10 was enriched in juvenile cortical and hippocampal microglia, and the minor cluster C7 was more prevalent in the cerebellum and corpus callosum of adult mice (Fig. 1d, e)


Furthermore, both demyelination-associated (SPP1+CD74−IBA1+ and TMEM119−CD74−IBA1+) and remyelination-associated (SPP1−CD74+IBA1+ and TMEM119−CD74+IBA1+) subsets of microglia were confirmed at the protein level by triple immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3f, g).


 MRP14−IBA1+ microglia.
