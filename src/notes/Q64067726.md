# Highlights

Here we produce an in silico planarian matrisome and use recent whole-animal single-cell-transcriptome data to determine that muscle is a major source of extracellular matrix (ECM). No other ECM-secreting, fibroblast-like cell type was detected. Instead, muscle cells express core ECM components, including all 19 collagen-encoding genes.

In vertebrates, lineage-restricted progenitors and/or dedifferentiation can produce new cells during regeneration6. Planarian neoblasts exclusively reside in the parenchyma, a dense tissue compartment with sparse ECM surrounding internal organs such as the central nervous system and the intestine3.
