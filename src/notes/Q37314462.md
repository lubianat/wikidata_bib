# Highlights

joost et al. use high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq to describe geneexpression in mouse epidermis and hairfollicles at unprecedented detail 

Unbiased clustering of 1,422 single-celltranscriptomes revealed 25 distinct populations ofinterfollicular and follicular epidermal cells

hile thecells of IFE and SG are constantly replaced, the HF is subjectedto cycles of rest (telogen), growth (anagen), and degeneration(catagen
 The telogen HF exhibits a characteristic micro-anatomy including the bulge and hair germ fuelling hair growth,the isthmus and junctional zone encompassing the opening ofthe SG, and the infundibulum connecting the HF to the IFE (Fig-ure 1B). The lower part of the HF closest to the hair-growthinductive dermal papilla is often referred to as the proximalpart, and consequently the upper HF as distal (Mu ̈ller-Ro ̈veret al., 2001).

 Intriguingly, only three of those subpopulations—the Gli1+upper bulge population (OB III) and the upper HF pop-ulations located around the SG (uHF I and uHF II)—were definedby unique genetic signatures. In contrast, most heterogeneity inthe HF seemed to result from the combination of recurring ge-netic signatures
