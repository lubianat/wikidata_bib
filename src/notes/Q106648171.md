# Highlights

Here, we have combinedDNA nanoball (DNB) patterned array chips andin situRNA capture to developStereo-seq  (Spatio-Temporal  Enhanced  REsolution  Omics-sequencing).  Thisapproach allows high sample throughput transcriptomic profiling of histologicalsections at unprecedented (nanoscale) resolution with areas expandable to centimeterscale, high sensitivity and homogenous capture rate. As proof of principle, we appliedStereo-seq to the adult mouse brain and sagittal sections of E11.5 and E16.5 mouseembryos
 Besides, as forhybridization-based methods, the measured areas are small (e.g., Visium 42.5 mm2,Slide-seq/Slide-seqV2 7 mm2, HDST 13.68 mm2and DBiT-seq 25 mm2)

Our aim was to develop a spatially resolved transcriptomic technology thatcombines billions of tightly packed barcodes in known positions with large-capturedareas, high capture rate and high reproducibility.

We first profiled the mouse olfactory bulb with Stereo-seq because it is awidely used model tissue for spatially resolved transcriptomic approaches 

Massive ISH and immunostainingprojects such as ABA (22) and the HPA (Human Protein Atlas) Brain Atlas (23),respectively, were developed to answer these questions but only test one gene orprotein at a time and lack perturbation context. 

Similarly, by integrating ourStereo-seq results with a published scRNA-seq dataset of mouse neocortex (24), wesuccessfully transferred the single-cell type labeling and identified the expectedlayer-specific gene expression pattern.


In summary, Stereo-seq is a spatially resolved transcriptomic technology withnanoscale resolution, centimeter level field of view, high sensitivity, minimal inter-binspace and high bin-to-bin reproducibility.
