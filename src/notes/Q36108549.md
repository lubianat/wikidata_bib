# Highlights

However, the full scope by which the microbiota impacts the function of all three ILC subsets remains elusive. Similarly, it remains to be investigated how ILCs integrate changes in the local tissue environment, including alterations in microbial colonization, into the gene regulatory landscapes. Recent investigations into the chromatin landscape of human and mouse ILCs suggested a potential role for subset-specific regulomes in this process (Koues et al., 2016, Shih et al., 2016).

 Because the small intestine of a mouse typically harbors less than 50,000 ILCs in each subset, obtaining accurate epigenetic profiling with conventional technology presents a major challenge. 


  We identified seven “ILC states” (ILC1a, ILC1c, ILC1d, ILC2a, ILC2c, ILC2d, and ILC3a) to be most responsive to alterations in microbial colonization, further corroborating the high degree of microbiota responsiveness of subsets ILC1 and ILC2. Comparison of gene expression profiles among all 15 subgroups revealed several interesting features. In line with the observations from bulk population RNA-seq, we noted an upregulation of ILC3-associated genes in ILC1s and ILC2s in the scenario of microbiota depletion, as exemplified by the appearance of Hk2 expressing ILC1 and ILC2 clusters
