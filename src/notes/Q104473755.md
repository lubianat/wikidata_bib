# Highlights
We developed a method that tests for hidden unsatisfiabilities in an ontology that arise when combined with other ontologies. For this purpose, we combined sets of ontologies and use automated reasoning to determine whether unsatisfiable classes are present. I

We tested the mutual consistency of the OBO Foundry and the OBO ontologies and find that the combined OBO Foundry gives rise to at least 636 unsatisfiable classes, while the OBO ontologies give rise to more than 300,000 unsatisfiable classes

The majority of biomedical ontologies are now being developed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) [1], a formal model-theoretic language based on description logics [2]. 

However, full import of an ontology is not always sensible or feasible. Even when an ontology makes heavy use of the classes and axioms in another ontology, only a subset of the classes are likely to be relevant within another ontology.

For example, the Hypertension Ontology (HTN) [9] expands upon the hypertension classes in the Human Phenotype Ontology (HP) [6] and the Disease Ontology (DO) [10], but is not concerned with any terms in those ontologies besides those directly related to hypertension. 

The MIREOT (Minimum Information to Reference an External Ontology Term) guidelines were originally developed to support inclusion of classes from non-OBO Foundry ontologies without needing to align to their axiomatisation, and has become a standard for term re-use and inclusion throughout the biomedical ontology community [13].


More recently, our prior analysis of the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) [16] showed that the use of MIREOT has the potential to cause inconsistency and unsatisfiabilities across the set of ontologies the EFO references [17]. 

In the rest of this paper, we will refer to the core ontologies as the OBO Foundry ontologies, while the wider set of ontologies will be referred to as the OBO ontologies. There are 9 OBO Foundry ontologies considered in this work, and a further 123 OBO ontologies.
