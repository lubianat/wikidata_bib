# Highlights

Here we report immuneXpresso, a text-mining engine that structures and standardizes knowledge of immune intercellular communication.

We also built a global immune-centric view of diseases and used it to predict cytokine–disease associations. This standardized knowledgebase (http://www.immunexpresso.org) opens up new directions for interpretation of immune data and model-driven systems immunology.

To maximize discovery, research results must transition to organized standardized models of knowledge, on which automated computational processing can be deployed.

uilt immuneXpresso (iX), a comprehensive high- resolution knowledgebase of directional intercellular interactions that was text-mined from all available PubMed abstracts across a broad range of disease conditions.

for each individual sentence, the analysis pipeline tagged cells, cytokines and diseases, as well as standardized terminol- ogy through official ontologies to allow for hierarchical data analysis at multiple resolutions (Supplementary Tables 1–4).

We distinguished between ‘outgo- ing’ relations (describing cytokine secretion by a given cell type) and
‘incoming’ relations (describing events in which a cytokine affected a cell type, either directly via binding or indirectly).

Our machine learning–derived knowledgebase covered 79% of the interactions described in the reference book, yet it was approximately five times larger, containing an additional 3,055 directional interactions.

iX is freely accessible for querying through http:// www.immunexpresso.org, as well as via the ImmPort web site30

--> Site is working. Dataset is a good candidate for Wikidata integration. 

Intelligent systematized interpretation requires having a machine- readable map of how immune components are connected and a for- malized reasoning framework on which one could test hypotheses and refine knowledge. Here we built immuneXpresso, a framework that structures and standardizes our knowledge of immune intercellular interactions, under many conditions, and updates periodically.

To identify mentions of biological enti- ties of interest (diseases, cells and cytokines) within article abstracts, we applied a dictionary-based approach with dictionaries either adapted from standard public knowledgebases or assembled from scratch
