# Highlights

n. Here we identify a critical role for NOTCH3 signalling in the differentiation of perivascular and sublining fibroblasts that express CD90 (encoded by THY1)

Our results indicate that synovial fibroblasts exhibit a positional identity that is regulated by endothelium-derived Notch signalling, and that this stromal crosstalk pathway underlies inflammation and pathology in inflammatory arthritis.


. We used graph-based clustering7, differential expression analysis and canonical markers to identify four major stromal subpopulations (Fig. 1a): VWF-expressing vascular endothelial cells, PRG4-expressing fibroblasts (PRG4 encodes lubricin, also known as proteoglycan 4 or PRG4), THY1-expressing fibroblasts (THY1 encodes CD90) and MCAM-expressing mural cells (MCAM encodes CD146)

Flow cytometry data revealed that lining fibroblasts constitute the majority (48%) of stromal cells in osteoarthritis, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis the synovium is characterized by the expansion of sublining fibroblasts (52% in rheumatoid arthritis compared with 31% in osteoarthritis, P = 0.002)

 However, in our scRNA-seq dataset, we found that lining and sublining fibroblasts were not separated into entirely distinct clustersâ€”instead the two populations were connected, which suggests the presence of intermediate subpopulations (


Fibroblasts exhibit positional identity
Because the synovial lining and the sublining are anatomically defined, we proposed that this gradual transition in the expression of fibroblast markers might form part of a broader transcriptional gradient that encodes fine-grained positional identity. 

Endothelial cells provide positional cue for fibroblasts
