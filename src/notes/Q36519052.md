# Highlights
Papers from PubMed with the keyword ‘Xenopus’ are imported into Xenbase and split into two curation tracks. In the first track, papers are automatically associated with genes and anatomy terms, images and captions are semi-automatically imported and gene expression patterns found in those images are manually annotated using controlled vocabularies. In the second track, full text of the same papers are downloaded and indexed by a number of controlled vocabularies and made available to users via the Textpresso search engine and text mining tool.


At this stage, papers irrelevant to current curation processes, such as those using Xenopus oocytes for cellular biology experiments, are excluded.

The curator annotates image captions for gene expression patterns via a custom web-based curation system (Figure 2). In the future, this curation is likely to be expanded to include additional data types such as phenotypes, gene regulation, transgenics and protein localization.

A controlled vocabulary of gene symbols and synonyms drawn from the Xenbase gene catalogue describe what is expressed

Anatomy items (i.e. tissues, organs and cell types), ‘where’ genes are expressed, are represented using the Xenopus Anatomy Ontology (XAO)

Curation bottlenecks

Another problem is that the controlled vocabularies Xenbase uses are not yet comprehensive enough to capture all the terminology used in literature. This is especially the case with the XAO

Curators will define new terms and integrate them into the XAO in relation to existing terms. This may involve examining anatomy ontologies for other vertebrates such as mouse or zebrafish or through consultation with other ontology development teams such as National Center for Biomedical Ontology (www.bioontology.org), Uberon (www.uberon.org), the common amphibian anatomical ontology (www.amphibanat.org) or Phenoscape (www.phenoscape.org).
