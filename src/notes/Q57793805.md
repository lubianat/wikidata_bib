# Highlights

Since 2003, the PDB has been managed by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org), an international consortium that collaboratively oversees deposition, validation, biocuration, and open access dissemination of 3D macromolecular structure data. 

Structure and experimental data/metadata are also stored in the PDB Core Archive using the readily extensible wwPDB PDBx/mmCIF master data format, which will continue to evolve as data/metadata from new experimental techniques and structure determination methods are incorporated by the wwPDB

Since 2003, the PDB has been managed jointly by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB) consortium (2), including the US Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB; rcsb.org) (3), the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe; pdbe.org) (4), Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj; pdbj.org) (5) and BioMagResBank (BMRB; www.bmrb.wisc.edu) (6). The wwPDB partners are committed to ensuring adherence to the FAIR Principles of Findability-Accessibility-Interoperability-Reusability (7).


 In 2017, the FTP archive recorded >450 million structure data file downloads, and at the individual wwPDB partner websites they numbered >220 million (Figure 3).

 To improve consistency of data within the PDB Core archive, wwPDB biocurators routinely update PDB entries with new or corrected metadata, such as citation information or updates triggered by changes to the CCD
