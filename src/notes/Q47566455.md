# Highlights

The SynBioHub repository (https://synbiohub.org) is an open-source softwareproject.

By connecting to relevant repositories (e.g.  the iGEM repository, JBEIICE, and other instances of SynBioHub), the software allows users to browse, upload,and download data in various standard formats, regardless of their location or repre-sentation. 

Nu-merous so-calledgenetic design automation(GDA) tools and techniques are now emerging toaid in the design of engineered biological systems.

The initial version of SBOL focused upon exchanging genetic descriptions of parts at theDNA level, while SBOL version 225,26supports other types of genetic circuit components,including  proteins,  RNAs,  and  small  molecules. 

he SBOL Stack pioneered the concept of using an RDF triplestore to store SBOL dataas triples, and retrieving designs in whole or part using SPARQL queries.30SynBioHub takesthis further by providing a complete user-facing Web interface.
Therefore, SynBioHub provides several simplified means of search
