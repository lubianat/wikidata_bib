# Highlights

Here, we built AgeAnno (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/AgeAnno/#/), a knowledgebase of single cell annotation of aging in human, aiming to provide comprehensive characterizations for aging-related genes across diverse tissue-cell types in human by using single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing data (scRNA and scATAC).

There are several available aging databases, such as Human Aging Genomic Resources, Aging Atlas, the Digital Ageing Atlas, AGEMAP and Open Genes (https://open-genes.com/) (10â€“13). These databases mainly focused on providing integrated biological datasets or a simple collection of aging-associated genes.
