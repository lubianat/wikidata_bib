# Highlights
RDFScape is a plugin that has been developed to extend a software oriented to biologicalanalysis with support for reasoning on ontologies in the semantic web framework.
RDFScape is implemented as a Cytoscape plugin. It makesuse of external libraries for managing ontologies and rea-soning,  and  it  provides  additional  logic  to  map  these  tographs represented in Cytoscape

In the first case, the plugin presents the user with a choiceof  panels  to  perform  queries:  a  SPARQL  query  panel.

Towards reasoning on pathwaysHere we show how inference can be used on pathways toanswer specific queries. We refer to [25] for an introduc-tion to queries on pathways and we focus on an examplederived from this work: “Find all genes whose expressionis directly or indirectly affected by a given compound”.

These  results  show  that  it  is  possible  to  use  inferencewithin  an  interactive  environment:  query  times  are  con-tained  and  the  most  demanding  task,  reasoning,  is  stillperformed  in  an  acceptable  time  (this  task  must  be  per-formed  only  when  reasoning  parameters  or  the  set  ofontologies of interest change).
However,  it  should  be  noted  that  wrong  settings  of  theinference process, and possibly some ontologies, can eas-ily result in unacceptable reasoning and answering times,in execution of infinite loops by the reasoner, or can makethis  exceed  the  memory  capacity  of  an  average  worksta-tion
