# Highlights

We provide the UCSC Cell Browser as a free website where scientists can explore a growing collection of single-cell datasets and a freely available python package for scientists to create stable, self-contained visualizations for their own single-cell datasets. Learn more at https://cells.ucsc.edu.

The UCSC Cell Browser allows scientists to visualize the output of these single-cell analysis methods. Its primary display is a two-dimensional scatter plot, most commonly the output of tSNE or UMAP dimensionality reductions (Fig. 1, upper panel center). 

. Cells can be selected, either by visually selecting groups or by combining one or more metadata-based filters (Edit > Find Cells). Cell identifiers can be exported for use in other analyses (Edit > Export Cells).
