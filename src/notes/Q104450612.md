# Highlights

Here, we report the existence and extent of gene expression and chromatin accessibility artifacts introduced during sampling and identify experimental and computational solutions for their prevention.

Although we have previously demonstrated that cryopreservation is a viable option  for  single-cell  studies3, theeffect  of  the  sampling  time  on  single-cell  RNA  (scRNA-seq)  and ATAC (scATAC-seq) sequencing datasets has not been addressed.In  this  work,  we  designed  benchmarking  experiments  to  systematically  test  the  effect  of  varying processing times on single-cell transcriptome and epigenome profiles from healthy and diseased donors

Sampleswere  either preservedimmediately (0 hours) or after 2, 4, 6, 8, 24 and 48 hours; simulating common scenarios in biobank andclinical routines.

This global effect  has  been  reported previously in  bulk  transcriptomics studies5,  pointing  to  a  reduction  of  the  transcriptional  rate  when  cells  are  removed  from  their physiological niche (37ºC) and stored at RT (21ºC).

First,  the Cold  Inducible  RNA  Binding  Protein(CIRBP)  and  the RNABinding  Motif  Protein  3(RBM3),two  cold-shock master  regulators6,were  up-regulatedin a time-dependent manner 


n  addition  to the  cold-shock  response,  we  observed  a  pronounced down-regulation  of  immune  cell  type  specific  genes (Fig.  1f, Supplementary  Fig.  6a)and  programs (Supplementary Fig. 5b,cand6d)pointing to a loss of identity in prolonged storage conditions.

We  report  that  varying  sampling  times  until  cryopreservation  is  a  driver  of  technical  variability  in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seqprofiles.
