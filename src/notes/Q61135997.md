# Highlights

Stem cell activity in the male germline is restricted to undifferentiated A-type spermatogonia (Aundiff); 

We uncover an unappreciated population within the self-renewing Aundiff fraction marked by expression of embryonic patterning genes and homeodomain transcription factor PDX1. Importantly, we find that PDX1 marks a population with potent stem cell capacity unique to mature, homeostatic testis and demonstrate dynamic interconversion between PDX1+ and PDX1âˆ’ Aundiff states upon transplant and culture.


 While there are ~35,000 As in an adult testis, only ~3000 cells have transplant capability7, suggesting that not all As are stem cells. Recent studies concluded that transplant activity is almost exclusively contained within a fraction of As marked by Id4 expression, supporting a revised As model in which stem cell activity is limited to a subset of As while remaining As plus Apr and Aal are differentiation-committed or transiting into a committed state5,8
