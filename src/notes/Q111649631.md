# Highlights
. With the development of lipidomics, we can now
understand the lipid compositional complexity of cells and start making sense of lipidome
dynamics. Lipidomes indeed vary among cell
types and are reprogrammed in differentiation
events. However, whether and how lipidome
remodeling assists changes in cell identity is not understood.


We coupled high-resolution mass
spectrometry imaging and single-cell mRNA
sequencing to resolve both lipidomes and
transcriptomes of individual dermal fibroblasts

We also found that lipid
composition and signaling pathways are wired
in self-sustained circuits that account for the
metabolic and transcriptional fibroblast heterogeneity.


By studying the lipid composition of individual cells, we found that
lipids play a driving role in the determination of cell states.

The division of labor is a fundamental
organizational principle of multicellular
organisms that is implemented through
transcriptional programs resulting in cell
types. However, phenotypic heterogeneity
can occur across cells of the same type, resulting in different cell states (1â€“3). These varying
cell states can have physiological significance
such as priming diverging differentiation programs (4) or contributing to distinct cellular
tasks in physiological processes (5).
