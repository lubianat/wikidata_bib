# Highlights
We recognized the importance of extracting the nucleus for transcriptomic success and maximizing membrane integrity during nucleus extraction for morphology success. The protocol is generalizable to different species and brain regions, as demonstrated by capturing multimodal data from human and macaque brain slices. 

 Following fixation, the biocytin is reacted with DAB as chromogen to generate a dark precipitate that fills the neuron, enabling imaging and a digital morphological reconstruction. In the Patch-seq technique, the neuronâ€™s cytoplasm is collected at the end of the recording, then processed via RNA-seq to identify its gene expression patterns.

 Extracting the nucleus is key to optimize transcriptomic data quality

 Another advantage using the tools described here is that MIES saves data in NWB:N 2.0, the open data format adopted by a number of labs, including all electrophysiology data deposited in the Allen Cell Types Database and BICCN.
