# Highlights

First Stage involves the designing of framework for semantic web-based system. Second stage builds the prototype for the framework using Protégé tool. Third Stage deals with the natural language query conversion into SPARQL query language using Python-based QUEPY framework.

Second stage is NLQ to SPARQL conversion for which QUEPY tool is used which is a python-based framework. 

Special form of regular expressions is used for converting NLQ to SPARQL and then expresses semantic relations in a convenient way (Quepy, in press). The first approach to run SPARQL queries is through protégé
