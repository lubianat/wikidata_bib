# Highlights

worldwide PDB (wwPDB) is the international collaboration that manages the PDB archiveaccording  to  theFAIRprinciples:  Findability,  Accessibility,  Interoperability  andReusability. The wwPDB recently developed OneDep, a unified tool for deposition, valid-ation and biocuration of structures of biological macromolecules. 

e  Worldwide  PDB  (2)(wwPDB, wwpdb.org) was formed in 2003 to ensure glo-bal management of the PDB archive for the public good.

 Research   Collaboratory   forStructural  Bioinformatics  PDB  (RCSB  PDB)  (1)  in  theUnited  States,  the  PDB  in  Europe  (PDBe)  (3)  and  PDBJapan  (PDBj) 
 OneDep (7) is a unified tool that supports deposition,validation  and  biocuration  and  is  used  by  both  wwPDBBiocurators (hereafterBiocurators) and  PDB data depos-itors (hereafterData Depositors)

 The 17Biocuratorscurrently  working  across  the  wwPDB  have,among  them,  strong  domain  expertise  in  MX,  NMR,3DEM,  chemistry,  biochemistry  and  molecular  biology.

 The wwPDB biocuration workflow is controlledviaaninteractive   workflow   manager   (WFM),   which   informsBiocuratorswhen an automatic process has finished
