AliBaba: PubMed as a graph.
===========================
  
  [@wikidata:Q43433584]  

# Highlights

When searching such information using conventional search engines, e.g. PubMed, users see the data only one-abstract at a time and ‘hidden’ in natural language text. ALIBABA is an interactive tool for graphical sum- marizationof searchresults. Itparses theset of abstractsthat fit aPubMed query and presents extracted information on biomedical objects and their relationships as a graphical network

ALIBABA extracts associations between cells, diseases, drugs, proteins, species and tissues

Afterclickinganode,more information on this entity is shown in the lower part, including syno- nyms encountered in the abstracts with links to external databases (UniProt, MeSH, NCBI Taxonomy, MedlinePlus, PubMed), as well as sentences from abstracts mentioning this entity.

It will also show the textual evidence, i.e. all sentences found in the abstracts that discuss the picked relation.

ALIBABA uses a dictionary-based approach for recognizing biomedi- calobjects

The extraction module achieves an F1-measure of 61% (maximum recall of52% at 75% precision), as evaluated on the SPIES corpus (Hao et al., 2005)

--> "maximum recall of 52% at 75% precision" is a great way to describe it! Way better than just numbers of abstract metrics, like F1 or AUC.
