# Highlights

arlier BioCreativechallenges involved many text mining teams in developing basic capabilities relevant to biological curation, butthey did not address the issues of system usage, insertion into the workflow and adoption by curators.

 InterActive Task (IAT) was introduced to address the utility and usability of text miningtools for real-life biocuration tasks.

 As Cohen andHersh point out, the major challenge of biomedical textmining is to make the systems useful to biomedicalresearchers

 --> So true
 

 The long term goal of the IAT is toencourage the development of systems that address real-life curation challenges by combining multiple textmining component modules to retrieve literature andextract relevant information for integration into thecuration workflow


In BC-III, the IAT task dealt with two important aspectssimultaneously: performance of the system (how accuratethe results of the given task are) and usability of theinterface (how user-friendly the interface is)

Defining the task: Monthly discussions with the UAGover a period of 9 months provided the guidelines forthe task described here


Systems should provide whatever means necessary to help the biocurator relate gene mentions tothe correct species.Another challenging use case is the introduction of anew gene name. The curator is then tasked with captur-ing the new gene name, species and linking it to a database identifier. In this case it is expected that thesystem could link to the organism genome database ifthe gene is not yet annotated in multi-species gene orprotein databases, such as Entrez Gene or UniProt
