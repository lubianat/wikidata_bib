# Highlights
It is important to acknowledge a tension between two different meanings of the term  “knowledge  discovery.”  One  meaning,  the  one  I  started  with,  is  to  assemble  pieces  of  information  into  new  wholes

The  other  meaning  is  to  analyze  and  synthesize  existing  data  to  impute  new  but  otherwise predictable, everyday information

8.2    “Gaps”—Linking Two Sub-fields that Reside inside of a Larger Field of InvestigationMy  own  group  has  focused  recently  on  linking  sub-fields  that  reside  within  a  larger  field  of  investigation. 

8.5    Scientific    ArbitrageDon  often  referred  to  literature-based  discovery  as  an  exercise  in  “scientific  arbitrage,”  in  which  certain  ideas  or  findings  are  under-valued  in  one  scientific  arena,  and  gain  in  value  by  applying  them  to  another  field.
