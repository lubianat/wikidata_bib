# Highlights
We explored how aging impacts transcriptional 
dynamics using single-cell RNA-sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated naive and effector 
memory CD4+ T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species.

Here, we dissect the activation dynamics of naive CD4+ T cells at the single cell level during 
aging in two inbred mouse sub-species separated by 1 million years of divergence: the 
reference C57BL/6J, Mus musculus domesticus (B6), and Mus musculus castaneus (CAST).

. Species-specific genes were not enriched for any 
functional ontology and were not the result of errors in genome assembly or read mapping 
(Fig. S3A-D). Species-specific transcribed genes are more variable on a cell-to-cell basis 
than genes expressed in both species, consistent with neutral drift (Fig. 1D, Fig. S3E)

The 225 up-regulated genes shared between B6 and CAST were enriched for cellular processes activated by 
immune stimulation (Fig. 3, table S3) and were expressed across most CD4+ T cells.

 In both B6 and CAST mice, genes involved in the activation 
process are typically expressed in fewer cells in old mice (Fig. 4C).
