# Highlights

In particular, we revisit the complexity of the SPARQL query language (considerably
extending and refining previous investigations from [26]) and study
both algebraic and semantic optimization of the query language
from a theoretical perspective.

In summary, our results show that operator OPTIONAL is by far the
most involved construct in SPARQL, which suggests that special
care in query optimization should be taken in this specific operator.

Complementary to algebraic optimization, we study constraintbased optimization, also known as semantic query optimization
(SQO), for SPARQL. The idea of SQO, which is well-known from
the context of conjunctive query optimization (e.g., [2]), deductive
database (e.g., [4]), and relational databases (e.g., [15]), is to exploit integrity constraints over the input database.

We now introduce two alternative semantics for SPARQL evaluation, namely a set and a bag semantics. The set-based semantics is
inspired by previous theoretical investigations in [24, 1]; the bag semantics closely follows the W3C Recommendation [32] and [25].
