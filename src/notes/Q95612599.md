# Highlights

In this project, we will explore the range of data-related decisions made during public health emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and analyze the flow of information, data, and metadata within networks of such decisions

The research is expected to yield best practice recommendations in terms of the sharing of data and metadata in the context of specific outbreak-related decisions by stakeholders ranging from individuals to groups and institutions to governments and international bodies
