# Highlights

e development of two new ontologies — the Kidney Tissue Atlas Ontology and the Ontology of Precision Medicine and Investigation — will support the creation of the Kidney Tissue Atlas, which aims to provide a comprehensive molecular, cellular and anatomical map of the kidney. These ontologies will improve the annotation of kidney-relevant data, and eventually lead to new definitions of kidney disease in support of precision medicine.

Ontologies are powerful tools for organizing, integrating and linking heterogeneous data types, especially in the biomedical sciences.

Significant additions to biomedical ontologies are necessary to better define kidney molecular and histopathological phenotypes, which is critical for kidney precision medicine.

 For example, a clinician could conclude that a patient has KDIGO CKD classification G3bA3 (ref.3) on the basis of the patient’s serum creatinine level and urinary protein excretion, but this description does not provide insights into the cause of the abnormal kidney function, which could be anything from diabetes mellitus to multiple myeloma to medication-associated nephrotoxicity.

 The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is an NIH-funded collaboration that aims to accelerate understanding of the most common forms of kidney disease by generating molecular and 3D imaging maps of reference kidneys and of kidneys from patients with AKI and CKD. 

 OBO currently includes more than 170 biomedical ontologies in domains such as phenotype24, disease19,20, anatomy16, genetics10 and proteomics18, and these ontologies have been used to successfully address a number of research questions in the biomedical sciences25

 his ability of the HPO to assess relationships through use of fuzzy matching and causal reasoning has potential to improve diagnostic insights.
