# Highlights

The proportion of polyploidy also increases with the aging process or with cellular stress such as surgical resection, toxic stimulation, metabolic overload, or oxidative damage, to involve as much as 90% of the hepatocytes in mice and 40% in humans. Hepatocyte polyploidization is generally considered an indicator of terminal differentiation and cellular senescence, and related to the dysfunction of insulin and p53/p21 signaling pathways.

 characteristic feature of hepatocytes is polyploidy, which is an increase in the numbers of chromosome sets per cell. Liver polyploidy occurs during postnatal development as an age-dependent process, as well as during repair in response to injury from various stress stimuli. Polyploidization in the liver has been studied widely and summarized in excellent reviews.
