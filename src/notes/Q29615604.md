# Highlights

The findings revealed shared chromosomal changes but also extensive transcription variation, including genes related to signaling, which represent potential therapeutic targets. The authors suggest that the variation in tumor cells reflects neural development and that such variation among cancer cells may prove to have clinical significance.


We excluded genes and cells with low
coverage (24), retaining ~6000 genes quantified
in 430 cells from five patient tumors and population controls (table S1).

All cells
outside the normal cluster exhibit chromosome 7 gain (red) and chromosome 10
loss (blue), which are characteristic of glioblastoma. (

  Normalization of CNV profiles using signal from
the “normal” cluster revealed coherent chromosomal aberrations in each tumor (Fig. 1C). Gain of
chromosome 7 and loss of chromosome 10, the two
most common genetic alterations in glioblastoma
(20), were consistently inferred in every tumor cell.
