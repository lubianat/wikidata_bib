# Highlights

nalysis of 14,685 single cell transcriptomes reveals a decrease in activated NSCs, 
changes in endothelial cells and microglia, and infiltration of T cells in old neurogenic niches

To address this gap, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the 
entire SVZ in three young (3 months) and three old (28–29 months) mice in three 
independent experiments (Fig. 1a, b). 

 We show that brain T cells express IFNγ and that several cells in the niche, including 
NSCs, exhibit an IFNγ response. The IFNγ response induced by T cells appears to be 
detrimental for NSC function in vitro and in vivo.
