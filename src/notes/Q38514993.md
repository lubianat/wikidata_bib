# Highlights
Whatizit is a suite of modules that analyse text for contained information, e.g. any scientific publication or Medline abstracts

A Web service-based TM solution centralizes and harmonizes crucial tasks and thus solves a number of difficulties reducing maintenance for users. 

whatizitChemical searches for chemical entities based on terminology from ChEBI and the identification of chemical terms by OSCAR3 (Corbett and Murray-Rust, 2006). whatizitDisease identifies disease terms using a controlled vocabulary (CV) extracted from MedlinePlus, whereas whatizitDiseaseUMLS allows access to MetaMap (Aronson, 2001). For whatizitDrugs the CV has been extracted from DrugBank (http://redpoll.pharmacy.ualberta.ca/drugbank/). whatizitGO is a pipeline searches for gene ontology terms using exact matching and considering morphological variability (Ashburner et al., 2000). Finally, whatizitOrganism identifies species names extracted from the NCBI taxonomy (NLM).

In the future, the annotation pipelines will be adapted to a common annotation scheme that would allow better exchange of annotated documents and interoperability of TM components
