# Highlights

Improvements in sequencing technology and molecular
biology are now leading to the emergence of genome-wide
quantitative analysis of single cells and, hence, to the conver-
gence of genomics and single-cell biology (Figure 1). We discuss
the importance of studying cell-to-cell variability using large-
scale and genome-wide techniques, while highlighting techno-
logical breakthroughs and new frontiers in single-cell biology.

Single-cell genomics was also applied in the study of homolo-
gous recombination in single germ cells. Homologous recombi-
nation creates unique hybrid haploid genomes in individual germ
cells by shuffling genetic information between homologous chro-
mosomes.

Several protocols for single-cell RNA-seq
have been published (reviewed in Shapiro et al. [2013]). In a
pioneering study from the Surani lab, reverse transcription was
performed directly on cell lysates from individual cells using
oligo-dT primers (Tang et al., 2009).

Applying the concept of stochastic
gene expression at the genomic scale will require innovative
metrics that discriminate technical noise from biologically mean-
ingful variation (Brennecke et al., 2013)
