# Highlights

Gene Teller is a voice assistant service based on the Alexa Skills Kit and Amazon Lambda functions that enables scientists to query for gene-centric information in an intuitive manner.

However, these two core improvements have happened largely on parallel tracks in isolation of each other, aside from applications in laboratories advanced by academic labs (Lubiane-Alves et al., 2018) and startups such as Helix (Halford, 2017). 


Entrez Gene 	Gene identifier, synonyms, Refseq summary 	What is the gene symbol for Entrez Gene 100? 
GeneRIF 	Literature associations of gene and function 	Tell me a fact about CCR2. 
GTEX 	RNA Tissue expression 	Where is the maximum expression of CCR1? 
ProteinAtlas 	Tissue specificity, subcellular localization 	What is the tissue specificity of TNF?
