# Highlights


Over the last decade an increasing share of biological experiments involve multiple technologies assaying different biological modalities, such as epigenetics, and RNA and protein expression, and thus the BioStudies database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies) was established to deal with such multimodal data. Its central concept is a study, which typically is associated with a publication. BioStudies stores metadata describing the study, provides links to the relevant databases, such as European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), as well as hosts the types of data for which specialized databases do not exist

ArrayExpress is one of the Core Data Resources of the European bioinformatics infrastructure ELIXIR since 2017 (8). 

The overarching goal of BioStudies is to support transparency and reproducibility of life sciences research by aggregating all the outputs of a study in a single place.

--> Nice! BioStudies is a model for  3.12 Linked GEO and curation of transcriptomics datasets

In fact, a BioStudies record is available for all open articles in Europe PMC that have auto-detected links to life sciences databases, supplementary materials, or both.

--> Nice! 

Since 2017, BioStudies is an ELIXIR Deposition Database (https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/elixir-deposition-databases) and the number of direct submissions is increasing rapidly.

A refined template selection and fields to capture single-cell specific attributes have been added to Annotare.

In 2020, single-cell RNA-seq experiments make up more than 10% of the submitted functional genomics experiments while microarray submissions continue to decline (Figure 3).

The endpoint changes from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/xml/v3 to https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/api/v1. A list of all searchable fields and their BioStudies equivalent is provided in the migration guide available as Supplementary Note and via https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/ArrayExpress/help.

The ArrayExpress migration will take place in two phases. During the first phase, scheduled to start in October 2020, all new datasets will be available both from the current ArrayExpress and BioStudies resources. The existing ArrayExpress datasets will become available via BioStudies and the user feedback will be collected. In the second phase, by summer 2021, the current ArrayExpress infrastructure will be deprecated and all data will become a part of the ArrayExpress data collection in BioStudies.

--> Nice! it will be soon.

The ArrayExpress migration to BioStudies reflects the changing field of life sciences, where multimodal high-throughput experiments have become a norm.
