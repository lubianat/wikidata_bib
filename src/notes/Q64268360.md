# Highlights

 To remove technical roadblocks for reusing these data, we have developed a web-application GREIN (GEO RNA-seq Experiments Interactive Navigator) which provides user-friendly interfaces to manipulate and analyze GEO RNA-seq data. GREIN is powered by the back-end computational pipeline for uniform processing of RNA-seq data and the large number (>6,500) of already processed datasets. 

 The web instance at https://shiny.ilincs.org/grein is deployed via robust Docker swarm of load-balanced Shiny servers. The complete GREIN infrastructure, including processing pipeline is deployed via Docker containers.
