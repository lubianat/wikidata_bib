# Highlights

Here we have analysed stem cell-derived
cerebral organoids using single-cell transcriptomics and accessible
chromatin profiling to investigate gene-regulatory changes that
are specific to humans.

cells diversified into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) of
multiple brain regions including the forebrain (dorsal and ventral telencephalon and diencephalon), midbrain (mesencephalon), hindbrain
(rhombencephalon) and retina


r single nucleotide changes (SNCs)

genes that have human-fixed SNCs, have undergone accelerated
evolution in humans (human accelerated regions (HARs)) or overlap
conserved regions that have been deleted in humans (hCONDELs)

COL6A1,
which has been shown to have a protective role in ageing neurons
