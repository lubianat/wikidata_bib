# Highlights

 We have developed PESCA, a scalable and generalizable method that leverages ATAC- and single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, to characterize cell-type-specific enhancers that should enable genetic access and perturbation of gene function across mammalian cell types

 This study demonstrates the utility of this platform for developing new cell-type-specific viral reagents, with significant implications for both basic and translational research.

ABAergic inhibitory interneuron cell types play an essential role in cortical signal processing by modulating neuronal activity, balancing excitability, and gating information


 To identify candidate SST interneuron-restricted gene regulatory elements (GREs), we carried out comparative epigenetic profiling of the three largest classes of cortical interneurons: somatostatin (SST)-, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing cells. T
