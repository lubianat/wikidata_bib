# Highlights
We solve this problem through the NeuroElectro project: a Python library, RESTful API, and web application (at http://neuroelectro.org) for the extraction, visualization, and summarization of published data on neurons' electrophysiological properties. Information is organized both by neuron type (using neuron definitions provided by NeuroLex) and by electrophysiological property (using a newly developed ontology). 

We describe and validate our semi-automated methodology for obtaining neuronal biophysical measurements directly from published reports in the literature (summarized in Figure 1). After obtaining full article texts from publishers, we then used text-mining algorithms to identify concepts specific to electrophysiology and neuron types, which we then validated manually.

 For each putative header element, we then used fuzzy string matching algorithms (implemented using the fuzzywuzzy library in Python: https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy), to assess the textual match between the header element and each of the electrophysiological synonyms.

  This difficulty arises in part because investigators use different criteria for classifying neurons, including electrophysiological, morphological, or molecular characteristics (Ascoli et al., 2008; Fishell and Heintz, 2013; Huang and Zeng, 2013).

To define canonical neuron types, we chose to use an existing list of approximately 250 neuron types and definitions provided by NeuroLex, a community-sourced, expert-defined collection of neuron types (http://neurolex.org; Shepherd, 2003; Hamilton et al., 2012; Larson and Martone, 2013).

Here, we identified and parsed distinct sentences within the methods section using tools provided within the Natural Language Tool Kit in Python (Bird et al., 2009).

This information can be used to make predictions about as yet unmeasured properties. Second, we have begun to explore the relationship between patterns of gene expression [using both the Allen Brain Atlas (Lein et al., 2007) and single cell qPCR approaches] and electrophysiological properties of neurons. Third, we have begun automated testing of quantitative neuron models in concert with SciUnit (Omar et al., 2014), under the reasonable assumption that these models should be constrained by the available experimental data. These projects are described in manuscripts currently in preparation.
