# Highlights
. F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. has developed a bespoke, manually maintained controlled vocabulary (RCV) for use in over-representation analysis. Many terms in this vocabulary group GO terms in novel ways that cannot easily be derived using the graph structure of the GO. For example, some RCV terms group GO terms by the cell, chemical or tissue type they refer to. Recent improvements in the content and formal structure of the GO make it possible to use logical queries in Web Ontology Language (OWL) to automatically map these cross-cutting classifications to sets of GO terms. 

We successfully mapped 85% of RCV terms to logical OWL definition.

Over 8000 GO classes have some direct or indirect logical link to a term from the Cell Ontology (CL) [9] or the Uber anatomy ontology (Uberon) [10].

We developed successful mapping queries (owl class expressions) for 308 out of 364 RCV terms and used OWL reasoning to find all classes equivalent to or subsumed by the mapping query for each RCV term (only 72 RCV classes had equivalent classes as well as subsumed classes in GO).

We also found and corrected a number of errors, including errors in axiomatization of developmental processes that led to incorrect inferences for RCV anatomy terms.
