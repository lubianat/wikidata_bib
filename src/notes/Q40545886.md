# Highlights

Single-cell profiling of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes identifies critical regulators
of T cell dysfunction in cancer, opening
new avenues for targeting dysfunctional
T cell states while leaving activation
programs intact.

. To gain a deeper molecular understanding of the dysfunctional T cell state, we analyzed
population and single-cell RNA profiles of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and used genetic
perturbations to identify a distinct gene module for
T cell dysfunction that can be uncoupled from T cell
activation.
