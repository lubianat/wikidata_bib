# Highlights
o this end, we have manually collected the structures, the physicochemical and pharmacological profiles of 1650 PPI inhibitors across 13 families of PPI targets in a database named iPPI-DB. To access iPPI-DB, we propose a user-friendly web application (www.ippidb.cdithem.fr) 
<!-- database is out -->

This could certainly help the PPI community to prioritize the selection of privileged chemotypes and
physcicochemical properties for a given PPI target class.

Nevertheless, the design of non-peptidic drugs with appropriate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties and, if possible, oral bioavailability has historically been highly desirable for patients and clinicians.

We have created the iPPI-DB, which contains the structure, the physicochemical
characteristics, the pharmacological data (biochemical and/or cellular binding data)
and the profile of the PPI target.

Moreover, on this activity, to prevent the collection of nonspecific binders, we imposed a 30 Î¼M threshold an regardless of assay type.
