# Highlights

Using a multi-resolution network-based analysis, we identify all major retinal cell types, and their corresponding gene
expression signatures. Heterogeneity is observed within macroglia, suggesting that human
retinal glia are more diverse than previously thought. Finally, GWAS-based enrichment
analysis identiﬁes glia, vascular cells, and cone photoreceptors to be associated with the risk
of AMD.

We used a curated set of known cell-type speciﬁc markers to
annotate individual cell groups. For each cell, we independently
imputed the expression proﬁle of cell-type speciﬁc markers and
aggregated them into a unique score per cell type.

While the diversity of neuronal
cell types in the retina is well established 19 , the complexity of
macroglia in the human retina is not well-understood.

Three subtype-speciﬁc
markers, FOS, FTL, and COL4A3, had signiﬁcantly higher
expression within their corresponding subpopulation (adjusted p-
value < 0.001, one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test) (Fig. 3d), which
we veriﬁed using ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization.
