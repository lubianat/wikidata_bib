# Highlights

nstead, our analyses revealed that these tumors contained distinct lineage-specific tumor propagating cells (TPCs) and this is reflective of the self-sustaining capabilities of lineage-specific stem/progenitor cells in the mammary epithelial hierarchy. By understanding the respective tumor hierarchies, we were able to identify CD14 as a TPC marker in the Neu tumor. Additionally, single-cell breast cancer subtype stratification revealed the co-existence of multiple breast cancer subtypes within tumors. Collectively, our findings emphasize the need to account for lineage-specific TPCs and the hierarchical composition within breast tumors, as these heterogenous sub-populations can have differential therapeutic susceptibilities.

Alternatively, neoplastic transformation of cells can also lead to plasticity (Koren et al., 2015; Molyneux et al., 2010) and the acquisition of any one of the aforementioned stem/progenitor-like states could have a unique role in tumor progression.

In the context of cancer, it has been proposed that differentiation hierarchies also exist among tumor cells, with cancer stem cells (CSCs) residing at the apex of the hierarchy within tumors (Nguyen et al., 2012). Although much progress has been made since the initial prospective isolation of CSCs in breast tumors (Al-Hajj et al., 2003), major gaps remain in the conceptual framework of breast CSCs (BCSCs)

BRCA1-null tumor cells were distributed amongst distinct clusters associated with C13, basal cells during gestation (C13:Bsl-G) and C12, basal cells (C12:Bsl) (Figure 2C), consistent with our initial observations of these cells having increased expression of basal genes (Figure 1Dâ€“E).
