# Highlights

The 2019 Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) Database Issue contains 168 papers spanning molecular biology. 

Major returning resources in the ‘Nucleic acid databases′ section include miRBase (5) which focuses on criteria to assess the reliability of microRNA entries and functional annotation from linked target predictions, external manual curation and text mining. For long non-coding RNAs and their targets, LNCipedia (6) contributes an update, also with a major focus on text mining and manual curation.


Elsewhere, two returning manually curated databases focus on protein complexes. CORUM (29) covers mammalian complexes and new features include a network-style visualization of subunit interactions and, most interestingly, a recognition and accounting of the impact alternative splicing can have on protein complex function. Complex Portal (30) presents a new interface incorporating visualizations of data from other databases on metabolism, protein structure and gene expression.
