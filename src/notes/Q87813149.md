# Highlights

w. The concrete innovation of the DBpedia FlexiFusion
workflow, leveraging the novel DBpedia PreFusion dataset, which we
present in this paper, is to massively cut down the engineering workload
to apply any of the vast methods available in shorter time and also make
it easier to produce customized knowledge graphs or DBpedias.

In this paper, we define a set of quality metrics and evaluate
them for Wikidata and DBpedia datasets of several language chapters


. From a top level view,
DBpedia is now separated into 5 different groups, which are produced by
separate extraction processes with separated dependencies: 
- generic (automatically extracted information from raw infoboxes and other sources)
-  mappings (mapping-aided infobox extraction)
-  text (article abstracts and textual content),
-  and wikidata (Wikidata facts mapped to DBpedia ontology [5])
