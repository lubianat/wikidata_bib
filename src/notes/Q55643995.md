# Highlights
Here we identify hundreds of new drug-disease associations for over 900 FDA-approved drugs by quantifying the network proximity of disease genes and drug targets in the human (protein–protein) interactome.

In this study, we developed a systems pharmacology-based platform that quantifies the interplay between disease proteins and drug targets in the human protein–protein interactome with state-of-the-art pharmacoepidemiologic methods for hypothesis validation using longitudinal data with over 220 million patients. 

To improve the data quality of the human interactome, we used only five types of experimental data:
(a) binary PPIs obtained using systematic, unbiased, high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) systems19; 
(b) kinase-substrate interactions from literature-derived low-throughput and high-throughput experiments; 
(c) binary PPIs from three-dimensional (3D) protein structures; (d) signaling networks from literature-derived low-throughput experiments; and (e) literature-curated PPIs identified by affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP-MS), Y2H, and/or literature-derived low-throughput experiments in which every interaction is supported by multiple sources of experimental evidence (Methods section). 

 The high-confidence predicted drug-disease association network connects 22 types of cardiovascular disease (outcomes) (red circles) and 431 FDA-approved non-cardiac drugs.
