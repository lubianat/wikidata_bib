# Highlights

Erythroblastic islands are a specialized niche that contain a central macrophage surrounded by erythroid cells at various stages of maturation

--> Cool

fetal liver macrophages exhibit a unique expression signature that differentiates them from erythroid and adult macrophage cells
ythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF)/KLF1 in this identity is shown by expression analyses in EKLF-/- and in EKLF-marked macrophage cells

The strongest evidence for a specific macrophage subtype in the erythroblastic island comes from the mouse, where F4/80 antigen and Forssman glycosphingolipid expression, but not Mac1 expression, are enriched in these cells

. Of relevance to human biology (May and Forrester, 2020), although the positive effects of EKLF expression on island macrophage function have been previously noted (Lopez-Yrigoyen et al., 2019), it is also relevant that a recent single-cell analysis of human FL hematopoiesis shows that EKLF and many of its target genes identified in the present study are also expressed in the ‘Vcam1+ erythroblastic island macrophage’ cluster (Popescu et al., 2019).

# Comments

The discussion in the text is always in the general level of archetype, even though they only study mice! They do make a connection in the last paragraph, though.
