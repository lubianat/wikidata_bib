# Highlights
The standardization, portability and reproducibility of analysis pipelines are key issues within the bioinformatics community. Most bioinformatics pipelines are designed for use on-premises; as a result, the associated software dependencies and execution logic are likely to be tightly coupled with proprietary computing environments. 

All nf-core pipelines are written in Nextflow and so inherit the ability to be executed on most computational infrastructures, as well as having native support for container technologies such as Docker and Singularity. 

Best-practice pipelines are available to be deployed on virtually any computational infrastructure. Community-built tools help pipeline developers to create new pipelines and adhere to nf-core guidelines. Slack, Twitter and events such as hackathons allow both users and developers to actively participate in the nf-core community. CI, continuous integration.

The primary portal to the nf-core community is its website (https://nf-co.re), which lists available analysis pipelines, user- and developer-centric documentation, and tutorials, as well as usage and contributor statistics. All code is hosted on GitHub under the nf-core organization (https://github.com/nf-core/) and released under the highly permissive MIT license, encouraging downstream modification and reuse.
