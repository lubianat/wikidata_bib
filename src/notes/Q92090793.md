# Highlights

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis suggested that affected pathways regulate synapse function as well as neural outgrowth and migration. Furthermore, in patient samples, specific sets of genes enriched in upper-layer projection neurons and microglia correlated with clinical severity.

unbiased single-
nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) (4) of 41
postmortem tissue samples including prefrontal
cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
from 15 ASD patients and 16 controls (Fig. 1A
and data S1).

We generated 104,559 single-
nuclei gene expression profiles—52,556 from
control subjects and 52,003 from ASD patients
(data S2)—and detected a median of 1391 genes
and 2213 transcripts per nucleus, a yield that is
in agreement with a recent snRNA-seq study

the increased density of protoplasmic astrocytes
and to confirm the expression of markers for
neurogranin (NRGN)–expressing neurons and
subtypes of astrocytes (fig. S3, A to D).

L2/3 excitatory neuron

(I) Burden analysis on downsampled
data. P values were calculated by comparing numbers of DEGs
between cell types (Mann-Whitney U test)

<!-- This type of analysis is very nice! Answers the question of "which cell types are most changed in this condition"  -->
