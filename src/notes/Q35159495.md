The Molecular Biology Database Collection: 2003 update

# Highlights
 The databases included in this Collection provide new value to the underlying data by virtue of curation, new data connections or other innovative approaches. Short, searchable summaries and updates for each of the databases included in this Collection are available through the Nucleic Acids Research Web site at http://nar.oupjournals.org .


 Anecdotally, there is a similar lack of awareness or familiarity with the tools available through the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and, quite surprisingly, the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health, even though many biologists visit the NCBI Web site frequently.


The databases listed in this Collection distinguish themselves by their approach to presenting the underlying data—by adding new value to the underlying data by virtue of curation, by providing new types of data connections, or by implementing other innovative approaches that facilitate biological discovery

# Comments
--> I wonder how many of those are still active. Could be a nice mini project...
