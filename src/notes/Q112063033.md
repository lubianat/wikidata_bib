# Highlights

 We propose a parallel architecture, where both NER and NEN are modeled as a sequence-labeling task, operating directly on the source text. We examine different harmonisation strategies for merging the predictions of the two classifiers into a single output sequence.

 he concepts are linked to 8 different ontologies, as shown below (ontology in parentheses):

CHEBI: chemicals/small molecules (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest [24])

CL: cell types (Cell Ontology [25])

GO_CC: cellular and extracellular components and regions (Gene Ontology [26])

GO_BP: biological processes (Gene Ontology)

GO_MF: molecular functionalities possessed by genes (Gene Ontology)

MOP: chemical reactions and other molecular processes (Molecular Process Ontology [27])

NCBITaxon: biological taxa and organisms (NCBI Taxonomy [28])

PR: proteins, genes, and transcripts (Protein Ontology [29])

SO: biomacromolecular entities, sequence features (Sequence Ontology [30])

UBERON: anatomical entities (UBERON [31])


t highly ambiguous tokens like prepositions, numbers, or single letters must be interpreted correctly in context (e. g. “of” in “inhibitor of calpain”, “I” in “hexokinase I”)

Example phrase with a discontinuous annotation (“ES ... cells”, solid red spans) that partially overlaps with a contiguous annotation (“somatic cells”, dashed blue spans). The annotations are simplified in two steps (unification and unnesting), for which different strategies are compared. In this example, the six possible combinations produce four different outcomes, of which three have lost one annotation entirely
