# Highlights

 In this manuscript we present the online version of the COlleCtion of Open Natural prodUcTs (COCONUT): an aggregated dataset of elucidated and predicted NPs collected from open sources and a web interface to browse, search and easily and quickly download NPs. COCONUT web is freely available at https://coconut.naturalproducts.net.

 Super Natural II [3] is considered as the largest among all the NP databases, is accessible online in 2020, but it seems not to be maintained anymore and is mainly composed of compounds that can be purchased.

 Studies [10, 11] showed that fragments from NPs present in COCONUT have high diversity and structural complexity, which makes it, among other possible applications, a suitable source for drug discovery and can be included in drug design pipelines. Our next step was to make this data available to the scientific community as a full-fledged online natural products database, maintained at https://coconut.naturalproducts.net.
