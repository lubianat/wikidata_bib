# Highlights

The Gramene project (http://gramene.org) contributes to the establishment and stewardship of open data, specifically plant genomes and pathways, to assist plant scientists in accessing, analyzing and visualizing datasets to address important biological questions and formulate data-driven hypotheses (1). Plant Reactome (https://plantreactome.gramene.org) (2) is the Gramene's pathway knowledgebase that adopts the Reactome data model (3) to represent various types of reactions associated with plant pathways and biological processes in the context of their subcellular location within a plant cell. 

We continue to utilize a combinatorial approach involving manual curation of reference rice pathways and automated gene orthology-based projection to scale up pathway knowledge to other species rapidly. 

To assess the scope and the quality of comparative pathway projections, we used the Plant Reactome API to grab all terminal pathways from the event hierarchy for all available species and then used two Python scripts, ‘orthology_data_grabber.py’ and ‘orthology_rebuilder.py’ (available at https://github.com/PlantReactome/external-data-analysis/tree/master/orthology_stats

--> I like that explicit mention of code, but they could have put it in a stable format


In summary, our scientific, cyber-infrastructure, and community-building efforts and contributions have had a profound impact on the plant research community. We continue to seek feedback from users and consult the experts in reviewing curated pathways. We also invite the community to expand and enhance the model for exploring gene interactions by contributing gene-gene interaction data across the scope of the plant species we currently support
