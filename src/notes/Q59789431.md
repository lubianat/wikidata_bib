# Highlights

We have developed a data-driven nonparametric method to identify outliers in PDB data based on kernel probability density estimation

Archived data for each PDB structure, designated with a unique 4-character identifier (e.g., 1vol), include atomic coordinates, experimental data, and supporting metadata

Our overarching goal is to ensure Findability-Accessibility-Interoperability-Reusability of PDB data19.

An outlier is “an observation which deviates so much from other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism”24.

--> Good definition of an outlier

Herein, we demonstrate that effective outlier identification for PDB data can be accomplished by ranking the probability density for each datum

# Comments
Cool stuff, outside my expertise, though.
