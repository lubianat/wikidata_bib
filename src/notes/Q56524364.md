===========================
  
  [@wikidata:Q56524364]  

# Highlights

A data-management plan explains how researchers will handle their data during and after a project, and encompasses creating, sharing and preserving research data of any type, including text, spreadsheets, images, recordings, models, algorithms and software. It does not matter whether the data are generated by large pieces of research equipment, such as imaging tools or particle accelerators, or from straightforward field observation.

• Define appropriate data file formats (see go.nature.com/2tvoo6v for UK formats).
• Assign responsibility for long-term data curation to a suitable office.

“Data management is inevitably going to be an essential skill in the open-science era,”

Such a plan, she notes, can also help scientists to avoid potential problems with data loss and reproducibility. “It may save you a lot of unforeseen trouble,”
