# Highlights

The US Research Collaboratory for Structural BioinformaticsProtein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) provides an integrated portal to the PDB archive that streamlines access for millions ofworldwide PDB data consumers worldwide. Herein, we review online resources made available free of charge by the RCSBPDB to basic and applied researchers, healthcare providers, educators and their students, patients and their families, and thecurious public. We exemplify the value of understanding cancer-related proteins in 3D with a case study focused on humanpapillomavirus

n thisreview article, we use human papillomavirus (HPV) as acase study to highlight several diverse examples from thiscontinuously growing corpus of 3D biostructure informa-tion


All 3Dstructures coming into the PDB are processed by thewwPDB global deposition, validation, and biocurationsystem known as OneDep [12]

Aflexible Advanced Search Query Builder allows inter-active construction of Boolean Operator combinations ofsearches on a variety of subjectfields,

--> Cool!

 RCSB PDB hostsa web portal, PDB-101 (pdb101.rcsb.org), that brings theresults of structural biology to the education and lay com-munities [38]
