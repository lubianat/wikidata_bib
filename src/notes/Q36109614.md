# Highlights
In this study, we describe miRSponge, a manually curated database, which aims at providing an experimentally supported resource for microRNA (miRNA) sponges. Recent evidence suggests that miRNAs are themselves regulated by competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) or ‘miRNA sponges’ that contain miRNA binding sites.

A submission page is also included to allow researchers to submit newly validated miRNA sponge data.

The lncRNA IPS1, originally discovered in plants, acts as a ceRNA by soaking up miR-399 to indirectly control the PHO2 gene which itself encodes a protein that negatively affects phosphate content in the shoots of Arabidopsis ( 13 )


Genetic knockout of miRNAs is potentially challenging as some miRNAs are transcribed from more than a single genomic locus ( 8 ). Hence, artificial miRNA sponges are often engineered and delivered by vectors as a way to investigate loss-of-function phenotypes or for therapeutic purposes ( 8 , 17 ).

The ‘Links’ page provides related resources of miRNA-sponge or ceRNA interactions, such as starBaseV2.0 ( 31 ), DIANA-LncBase ( 33 ) and LncACTdb ( 34 ). A web interface for miRSponge is freely available at http://www.bio-bigdata.net/miRSponge .
