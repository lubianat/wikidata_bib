# Highlights
]In the immature brain, GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) is excitatory, and GABA-releasing synapses are formed before glutamatergic contacts in a wide range of species and structures. GABA becomes inhibitory by the delayed expression of a chloride exporter, leading to a negative shift in the reversal potential for choride ions.

In spite of these caveats, it is clear that the concentration of [Cl−]i is higher in immature than in adult neurons by 20–40 mM. This is sufficient to shift the actions of GABA from inhibition to excitation (see Box 2 and below). So, in immature neurons, the net active chloride transport is inwards, so that anions flow out of the neuron when GABA channels are opened.
