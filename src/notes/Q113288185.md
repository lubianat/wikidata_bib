# Highlights

In this
paper, we first introduce the Newsadoo tag recommendation system,
which consists of three components: (1) item-based similarity, (2) knowledge graph similarity, and (3) actuality.

Newsadoo4
is a European media startup that provides articles from various
regional, national, and international newspapers as well as magazines on a single
platform.

The final tag recommendation result is obtained by merging the related tags
provided by the IBS and KGS components, computing a combined similarity
score for these tags and sorting the result accordingly.

We found that Wikipedia2Vec delivered the best results (in terms of suitability and diversity) for our application based on a qualitative evaluation with
domain experts.
