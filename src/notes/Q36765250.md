# Highlights

Aged haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) generate more myeloid cells and fewer lymphoid
cells compared with young HSCs, contributing to decreased adaptive immunity in aged
individuals.

Depletion of HSC platelet programming through loss
of the FOG-1 transcription factor is accompanied by increased lymphoid output. Therefore,
increased platelet bias may contribute to the age-associated decrease in lymphopoiesis.

To identify age-dependent intrinsic molecular changes to
HSCs, we have therefore taken advantage of recent progress in single-cell transcriptomics to systematically compare individualHSC transcriptomes from young and old mice

Platelet-biased HSCs preferentially expand during ageing. To
determine if the age-dependent increase in HSC platelet gene
expression was a general property of the HSC compartment, or
due to the selective expansion of the Vwf þ HSC subset, we
speciﬁcally investigated the age-dependent changes to HSC
lineage priming of Vwf þ and Vwf – HSCs at the single-cell level

We here identify increased platelet bias as a key feature of haematopoietic ageing in general, and of aged HSCs in particular, manifested by the expansion and predominance of a novel and functionally distinct HSC subtype in the aged haematopoieticsystem.

The absolute number of HSCs expands signiﬁcantly over time, both when measuring phenotypic and functional HSCs 5,10,13,15.
In contrast, the repopulating ability of aged HSCs has been reported to decline, both in terms of frequency of engraftment on transplantation 11 and level of contribution to the peripheral
blood
