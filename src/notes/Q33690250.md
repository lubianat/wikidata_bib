# Highlights
 Historically, it has not been possible to provide additional information about the context of a GO term, such
as the target gene or the location of a molecular function. This has limited the specificity of knowledge that can be
expressed by GO annotations.

The GO Consortium has introduced annotation extensions that enable manually curated GO annotations
to capture additional contextual details

While the ontological rigor of the GO vocabularies has
been enriched over the years through the use of expressive
formalisms that permit logical reasoning and interaction
with external ontologies [5], the annotations themselves
have, until now, remained simple declarative statements.

 Curators can add detail
to GO annotations using controlled vocabularies (either
GO or external ontologies, such as Cell Type Ontology
(CL) [8]; Uber Anatomy Ontology (Uberon) [9] or Plant
Ontology (PO) [10]) and biological entities such as genes
or their products. GO annotations with extensions thus
incorporate an increased level of detail and biological integration, supporting more sophisticated querying and analysis.

We created an application ontology that extends the OBO
(Open Biomedical Ontologies) Relations Ontology (RO)

The set of relations used fall into two broad categories –
molecular relations, which take an entity such as a gene,
gene product, complex or chemical as an argument; and
contextual relations


Table 1 Most commonly used relationships for annotation extension statements and examples of their usage
Contextual relationships Example (gene product; primary GO term; annotation extension)
part_of C. elegans psf-1; nucleus; part_of(WBbt:0006804 body wall muscle cell)
occurs_in Mouse opsin-4; G-protein coupled photoreceptor activity; occurs_in(CL:0000740 retinal ganglion cell)
happens_during S. pombe wis4; stress-activated MAPK cascade; happens_during(GO:0071470 cellular response to osmotic stress)
Molecular relationships Example (gene product; primary GO term; annotation extension)
has_regulation_target Human suppressor of fused homolog SUFU; negative regulation of transcription factor import into nucleus;
has_regulation_target(UniProtKB:P08151 zinc finger protein GLI1)
has_input S. pombe rlf2; protein localization to nucleus; has_input(PomBase:SPAC26H5.03 pcf2)
has_direct_input Human WNK4; chloride channel inhibitor activity; has_direct_input(UniProtKB:Q7LBE3 Solute carrier family 26 member 9)

--> Nice, very nice! I wonder how often these are used in practice nowadays, though. Both by GO and by end users. 

To illustrate, consider a gene product that has its activity in a neuron of the hippocampus. Here it would
be appropriate to make an extension combining two
expressions for both the cell type (neuron) and the
gross anatomical structure (hippocampus)

mAKAP has been
shown by immunocytochemical assay to be located on
the nuclear envelope of cardiomyocytes [20].
With the core annotation model, we are only able to
capture the cellular compartment that mAKAP is located
in ‘nuclear envelope’ (GO:0005635) with the evidence code
‘Inferred from Direct Assay’ (IDA).
Using the annotation extension model as follows, we
can capture the cellular and anatomical context of the
location of mAKAP such that mAKAP is annotated to
the term ‘nuclear envelope’ (GO:0005635) with the evidence
code IDA and with two Relation(Entity) pairs specifying the
cell and tissue locations of the nuclear envelope:
part_of(CL:0002495), part_of(UBERON:0002082)

--> very cool

Currently pathway analysis, which uses methods such
as term enrichment and pathway topology, is hampered by
the lack of functional annotation with associated contextual
aspects such as cell or tissue type or dependencies on other
gene products or substances [28]. GO has the potential to
enable great advances in pathway analysis by providing this
contextual information in annotation extensions.

--> Again, I wonder how often it is used in practice. 

We formalize the annotation extension model in terms of
Description Logics, and in particular the Web Ontology
Language (OWL) 

The GO annotation extension model is formally a relaxation of the core model, in that it allows the annotation to
be to any OWL Class Expression that conforms to the following profile.
ClassExpression ::= Class | ObjectIntersectionOf
(Class RelationalExpression+)
RelationalExpression ::= ObjectSomeValuesFrom
(ObjectProperty Class)

--> 1.2.2. Computational ontologies and their methods

We use the Elk reasoner to reason over annotation class
expressions


if a gene product is
annotated to ‘postsynaptic density’ (GO:0014069) and has
the extension field filled with “part_of(CL:0000127)”, this
is directly translated to the class expression ‘postsynaptic
density’ and part_of some astrocyte which is inferred to
have the MSC GO:0097483 (‘glial cell postsynaptic density’) based on equivalence axioms in the GO


Annotation extensions are created as part of the manual
curation process [6]. This involves biological database
curators reading full text, peer-reviewed articles to obtain
information about gene product functions, the processes
in which they are involved and their subcellular locations
[1-4].
