# Highlights
Hydra continually renews all cells in its body using three stem cell populations. This feature of Hydra allowed Siebert et al. to identify the transcriptional signatures of stem cells, progenitors, and terminally differentiated cells using single-cell RNA sequencing of adult Hydra

We generated ~25,000 single-cell transcriptomes from Hydra using Drop-seq, clustered the cells, and annotated cell states.

of the interstitial stem cell lineage. The lineage is
supported by a multipotent interstitial stem
cell (ISC) that gives rise to neurons, gland cells,
and nematocytes; ISCs are also capable of
replenishing germline stem cells if they are lost.

We next explored the specification of different
cell types within the interstitial lineage (Fig. 1D).
First, we examined nematocytes, which contain
one of the most complex eukaryotic organelles,
nematocysts (29); these are used to sting and
immobilize prey. Hydra nematocytes each have
one of four types of nematocysts: desmonemes,
holotrichous or atrichous isorhizas, and stenoteles
