=====================
  
  [@wikidata:Q104513823]  
  
Publication date : 21 of December, 2020  

# Highlights


 The ontology serves two major purposes:

    As a template to define context in COVID-19 specific text mining approaches.

    As a structured system of concepts and categories that helps to bring order into the COVID-19 knowledge space.

We demonstrate the usability of the COVID-19 Ontology in both cases.



The ontology comprises 2270 classes of concepts and 38 987 axioms (2622 logical axioms and 2434 declaration axioms).



COVID-19 Ontology is released under a Creative Commons 4.0 License and shared via https://github.com/covid-19-ontology/covid-19. The ontology is also deposited in BioPortal at https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/COVID-19.

--> CC is not enough


The ontology is used to annotate data and models in the COVID-19 Knowledge Space (https://www.covid19-knowledgespace.de). 

VID-19 Ontology mentioned here forms the basis for establishing the reference namespace for the COVID Knowledge Graph that encapsulates the molecular mechanisms around COVID-19 infection (Domingo-Fern√°ndez et al., 2020).
