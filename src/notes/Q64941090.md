# Highlights

s. With an ever-increasing amount of available ontologies and the development of adequate semantic technology, however, a solution to this problem becomes available. Instead of free text descriptions, morphological data can be recorded, stored, and communicated through the Web in the form of highly formalized and structured directed graphs (semantic graphs) that use ontology terms and URIs as terminology.

Morphological data that comply with the here proposed semantic data model will not only be computer-parsable but also re-usable by non-experts and could be better integrated with other sources of data in the life sciences. 

Moreover, while some terms refer to common spatio-structural properties, others refer to a common function or a presumed common evolutionary origin, or some mixture of those three categories (see Linguistic Problem of Morphology [2]). As a consequence, interpreting and analyzing morphological data becomes unnecessarily difficult for non-experts and integrating morphological data with other sources of data in the life sciences very difficult and time-consuming.

Unfortunately, in morphology, the use of ontologies is still very limited. Currently, only a small fraction of morphological data is eScience-compliant and that fraction is usually restricted to data about model organisms (e.g., [15,16,17,18,19]). However, an increasing amount of taxon-specific ontologies is becoming available (e.g., Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology [20, 21]; Spider Ontology [22]; Plant Ontology [23]; Vertebrate Trait Ontology [24]; Uberon multi-species anatomy ontology [25]; Cell Ontology [26]).
