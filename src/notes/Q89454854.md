# Highlights

 We performed a systematic comparison of Drop-seq and DroNc-seq using time-course data from human iPSCs differentiating into cardiomyocytes (CMs). This allowed us to compare Drop-seq and DroNc-seq with respect to read depth, transcriptome composition, cell types detected, and cellular differentiation trajectories. 

 We used the R package Seurat16 to perform normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization of individual cells, grouped by cell types (see Methods).


Both methods suggested the differentiation of iPSCs into an inter-mediate cell type (cardiac progenitors), and finally a population of clearly identifiable cardiomyocytes, based on the expression of TNNT2 and MYH6.The comparison of Drop-seq and 

We expect that DroNc-seq will be used to perform high-throughput transcriptomic profiling of tissues for which it is difficult to obtain suspensions of intact single cells and aid in initiatives such as the Human Cell Atlas and the Human Tumor Atlas.
