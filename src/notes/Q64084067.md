# Highlights
We developed a large-scale corpus of molecular papers derived from PubMed and PubMed Central open access records and used it to train deep learning word embeddings under the GloVe, FastText and ELMo algorithms. 

n this work, we hope to encourage biocuration systems developers to apply deep learning methods to their specialized tasks by repurposing large-scale word embedding to apply to their data.

 (i) identifying the detection methods used in individual molecular interaction experiments and (ii) document-level classification (‘triage’) for experimental studies containing legitimate work describing new interaction data. We sought to investigate a possible role for evidence-based language from articles’ results sections pertaining to figures for these two text classification tasks.

In order to limit our domain of discourse to molecular bioscience, we ran searches over PubMed and PMC based on a set of high-level terms within the MeSH controlled vocabulary hierarchy that pertained to molecular work.

 We also investigated the classifier’s performance at a simple yes/no classification task for specific common experimental methods: (i) use of western blot methods for participant detection and (ii) use of coprecipitation methods for interaction detection. Training data for these tasks are available from the Zenodo repository (20)
 We are grateful to Dr Pablo Porras for providing a list of 537 positive and 451 negative training examples of open access papers that either contain or do not contain scientific information pertaining to molecular interactions.

Within the evidence extraction project at ISI (https://github.com/SciKnowEngine/evidX/), we intend to use this approach to help us automatically identify experimental design templates for published molecular interaction experiments based on our ‘Knowledge Engineering from Experimental Design’ methodology (25).
