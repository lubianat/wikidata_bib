# Highlights

However, the precise ontogenetic relationships between CAMs and microglia remain poorly understood. Here we comprehensively characterize the distribution, kinetics, gene expression profiles and fates of perivascular and meningeal macrophages as well as microglia during the course of development, and elucidate the cellular machineries that drive the establishment of distinct CNS macrophages at specific time points and in distinct anatomical niches.

In contrast, IBA1+GFP+ meningeal macrophages were detectable in the leptomeninges at all investigated time points—even at E10.5, at which point Col IV+ meninges are being established during embryogenesis22,23.

perivascular macrophages are defined by their distinct location in the perivascular Virchow–Robin space, where they are sandwiched between two basal lamina

A lack of cell-type-specific targeting tools has hampered the definition and dissection of the precise ontogeny of CAMs, as well as their specific functions in health and disease. To genetically target CAMs, we generated a mouse line in which a T2A-CreERT2 cassette was inserted into the Mrc1 locus (hereinafter referred to as Mrc1CreERT2)

Using scRNA-seq, we identified a distinct Mrc1 (CD206)+ subset within the A2 pre-macrophage population. A previous study described a similar CD206+ yolk sac population and suggested that these cells were committed progenitors of CAMs, distinct from the microglia ancestry3
