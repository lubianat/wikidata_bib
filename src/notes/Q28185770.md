Publishing on the semantic web
==============================

# Highlights

The web was designed as an information
space, with the goal not only that it should be useful for human–human communication, but also that machines would be able to par- ticipate and help users communicate with each other.

The concept of machine-understandable documents does not imply some magical artificial intelligence allowing machines to comprehend human mumblings.

Papers that include this new mark-up language will be found by new and better search engines, so users will be able to issue significantly more precise queries.

Just as preprints challenge established journals’ online ver- sions, these new ‘papers in progress’ will be a significant challenge to online scientific publishers.

Does this sound like a crazy science-fiction dream? A decade ago, who would have believed a web of text, conveyed by computer, would challenge a 200-year-old tradition of academic publishing?
