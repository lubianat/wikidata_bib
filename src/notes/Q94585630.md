# Highlights

Here we review the current technologies used to identify and characterize cells, and
we discuss how experimental and pathological perturbations are adding increasing complexity to our definitions of cell identity

Current studies are seeking to generate integrated definitionsfor
cell types that encompass features and functions, but an enduring
challenge is that the contribution of a cell to a tissue varies according to its context

cell types that are stable during homeostasis in the
adult can perform new functions and/or acquire new features under damage or disease conditions, a phenomenon called plasticity.

--> cells from certain types, not "cell types"

Figure 1. Defining Cell Types
Shown are attributes used to categorize cells into
types (inner wedges) and strategies to assay them
(outer wedges). Cells can be classified according
to their functions (top), and their physical features
(bottom)

--> That is a cool figure! It sucks it is not under an open license.

his review aims to present the diversity of frameworks from
which to approach the problem of cell categorization, the tools
available to pursue them, and concepts and challenges to
consider in their interpretation and synthesis, with a predominant
focus on mammalian epithelial tissues

We focus on advances in pursuit of three major goals: (1) Detecting
features associated with a cell type from
a pre-defined list of candidates, (2) identifying new features and cell types
through unbiased approaches, and (3)
defining cellular relationships

Figure 2. Strategies to Detect Molecular
Features Associated with a Cell Type

--> Also very cool. Good collection of tools.

Goal 2: Identification of New Features or Cell Types

--> Differences between features and cell types

populations previously assumed to be homogeneous; for
example, the spatial variation of diverse cell types in the intestinal
epithelium, including tuft cells, enteroendocrine cells, and enterocytes (Beumer et al., 2018; Glass et al., 2017; Haber et al., 2017;
Herring et al., 2018; Moor et al., 2018). They are also uncovering
new and rare cell types (Grun et al., 2015; Jindal et al., 2018 â‚¬ ),
such as the pulmonary ionocyte in the mammalian airway (Montoro et al., 2018; Plasschaert et al., 2018).

The rapid advances of diverse technologies are dramatically expanding the dimensions along which cell identity can be defined.
These studies reveal the cellular composition of tissues with
increasing resolution and also point toward strategies to coax
cells to adopt features and functions of therapeutic value
