Potential for online crowdsourced biological recording data to complement surveillance for arthropod vectors

Of ten vector taxa investigated, records were most numerous for mosquitoes (Culicidae; 23,018 records, 222 species) and ticks (Ixodida; 16,214 records, 87 species), with most data from 2019â€“2020.

Once set up, citizen science projects can be continuously run at relatively low cost, making them a resource-efficient method of collecting large-scale vector data when compared to traditional active surveillance methods that require more time and resources to perform, particularly when attempting to cover large geographical areas.

In Europe, this mosquito was first detected in 1979 in Albania, then in Italy in 1990, from where it was able to colonize most of Italy and spread eastwards and westwards along the Mediterranean coast assisted by road transport. It is currently established along the entire coast of Southern Europe and is gradually expanding northwards [101] (Fig 6A), with repeated introductions detected in Northern European countries such as the Netherlands [102], Germany [103] and the UK [104]. As a result of established populations of Ae. albopictus, locally-transmitted cases of chikungunya, dengue and Zika viruses have been reported in France [105, 106], dengue in Croatia [105], and two large chikungunya outbreaks have occurred in Italy [107].
