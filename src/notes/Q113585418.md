# Highlights
. While there is already substantial knowledge on biodiversity globally, the knowledge is often concentrated in specific areas in our world. Fig. 1 is a map of occurrences of flora and fauna recorded in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). It shows that the recordings are unevenly distributed. Occurrences from Ghana and Nigeria seem to be underrepresented.

Number of Wikipedia articles on taxa in a select set of sub-Saharan languages (sample Wikidata query: https://w.wiki/5NpX).

We present a sub-project in the community project Wiki Mentor Africa. Here we record observations of different species and spread the acquired knowledge in Dagbani and Igbo, two languages spoken in the sub-Saharan region. For this we use two crowd-sourcing platforms, iNaturalist and the Wikimedia Stack comprising Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata. 

 This is possible since there are active links maintained between iNaturalist, Wikidata and Wikipedia.
