# Highlights

BioC is a simple XML format for text, annotations and relations, and was developed toachieve interoperability for biomedical text processing. Following the success of BioC inBioCreative IV, the BioCreative V BioC track addressed a collaborative task to build an as-sistant system for BioGRID curation

The curatorsâ€™ feedback was overall posi-tive and highlighted the user-friendly design and the convenient gene/protein curationtool based on text mining.

One of the goals of the BioC track was to provide a me-dium where different teams could work independently to produce  a  more  advanced  and  a  more  sophisticated  sys-tem  in  the  given  time.


The  authors  would  like  to  thank  Cecilia  Arighi  for  providingresources for the user questionnaire.
