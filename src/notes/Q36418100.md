# Highlights

A total of seven groupsparticipated in Track I. For the triage component, the effectiveness of participant systems was measured by aggregategene, disease and chemical â€˜named-entity recognitionâ€™ (NER) across articles; the effectiveness of â€˜information retrievalâ€™ (IR)was also measured based on â€˜mean average precisionâ€™ (MAP). Top recall scores for gene, disease and chemical NER were 49,65 and 82%, respectively; the top MAP score was 80%. Each participating group also developed a prototype web interface;these interfaces were evaluated based on functionality and ease-of-use by CTDâ€™s biocuration project manager. In thisarticle, we present a detailed description of the challenge and a summary of the results.


During September 2011, Track I issued an open invitationto text-mining teams to develop a system to assist biocura-tors in the selection and prioritization of relevant articlesfor curation for CTD


a training dataset was made available to partici-pants that consisted of 1725 articles that had been previ-ously triaged and curated by CTD biocurators


Three fields were provided for each data category,on a â€˜per articleâ€™ basis and included:â€˜Curated Termsâ€™â€”This field listed the terms, if any, thata CTD biocurator previously curated for each datacategory.â€˜Text Mined Termsâ€™â€”This field listed the text-minedterms, if any, that a participant provided for eachdata category.â€˜Match Explanationâ€™â€”This field provided an explan-ation  of  how  matches  between  the  curated  andtext-mined terms were determined. Because providingsynonyms to curated terms are counted as matches, thenotation ofCYP1!CYP1A1, for example, indicated thatthe termCYP1was text mined, which is a valid syno-nym for the actual underlying curated termCYP1A1;

In conclusion, the groups far surpassed expectations andare to be congratulated on their efforts and accomplish-ments in a short period of time. In addition to the successfulgeneration of systems that may have long-term applicationfor either CTD or other curated database groups, the suc-cess of the Track I program underscores the enhanced ben-efits that result from collaborative efforts among otherwisedisparate biological and computational groups
