# Highlights

Concurrently, these daughter neurons are also transitioning through states toward maturation. Telley et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing to survey the transcriptional identity of cells early in mouse brain development

Such temporal patterning is an evolutionarily conserved strategy to generate neuronal diversity, but in contrast to Drosophila, in which key molecules of temporal specification have been identified, how this occurs in mammals remains poorly understood.

Using this approach, we traced the transcriptional trajectories of successive generations of apical progenitors and their respective daughter neurons in mice from embryonic day 12 to day 15, as layer 6, 5, 4, and 2/3 neurons are successively generated.

The aggregate neurogenic competence of these ventricular zone progenitors (i.e., apical progenitors)
