# Highlights
Single-cell RNA-seq identifies an immune resistance program in malignant cells

 CDK4/6-inhibition represses this program in individual malignant cells, induces senescence, and reduces melanoma tumor outgrowth in mouse models in vivo when given in combination with immunotherapy. 
To recover potentially important genes that are also expressed by non-malignant cells (e.g., major histocompatibility [MHC] class I), we search for genes that are correlated with the seed program across the malignant cells in the scRNA-seq data irrespective of their expression in other cell types.

Synovial sarcoma, which is driven by a single genomic aberration in the BAF complex, has the highest resistance scores. The BAF complex plays a key role in ICI resistance (Pan et al., 2018), and one of its subunits (SMARCA4) is upregulated in the resistance program
