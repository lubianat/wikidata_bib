# Highlights

Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney)


The 18 cell clusters covered the entire spectrum of kidney cell types found along the nephron- and tissue-resident immune cells. Furthermore, we identified 2 DKD-specific clusters (disease-specific and disease-specific thick ascending loop of Henle) and 1 LD-specific cluster (transitional principal cell-intercalated cluster). The violin plots in Figure 2c and d show a restricted cell-type-specific mRNA expression of ACE2 in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), 

We clustered the DKD ACE2+ signature genes within this PTEC functional network (Figure 4a36
; Supplementary Table S2), and the resulting modules (Figure 4a; Supplementary Table S4) contained key processes of tubular function


Functional network analysis
To determine the biological processes and pathways in the ACE2+ differentially expressed gene sets, we performed functional network clustering in the PTEC gene functional network derived from GIANT 2.0.34
,35
Community clustering in the network was performed to identify tightly connected sets of genes with the use of HumanBase.io module detection function68
(https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney).


--> Uses some single-cell co-expression, perhaps interesting for 0.1 fcoex & FCBF
