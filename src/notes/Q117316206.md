# Highlights

Last but not least, sharing and publishing the results of network analysis in a computable and editable format is difficult, and most networks are published and presented only as static images in figures. Here, we present Network Data Exchange Integrated Query (NDEx IQuery), a new tool for network and pathway-based gene set interpretation.

 Queries made from other websites (e.g. www.cytoscape.org) via an HTTP GET request are limited to roughly 100 gene symbols because larger queries would exceed the maximum size of a URL.

 Cytoscape Exchange (CX) is a JSON-based network exchange format, a flexible structure for the transmission of networks. 

 NDEx IQuery is part of the Network Data Exchange (NDEx) infrastructure (https://www.ndexbio.org/). It draws on curated pathway content from WikiPathways (https://www.wikipathways.org/) and the SIGNOR database (https://signor.uniroma2.it/), as well as machine-assembled networks from the INDRA system (https://www.indra.bio/) and published pathway diagrams from the Pathway Figures OCR (https://pfocr.wikipathways.org/) open science project. NDEx IQuery is also integrated with the popular Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) (https://gsea-msigdb.org) and cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (https://www.cbioportal.org/).

 NDEx IQuery performs custom gene set analysis on a suite of 675 curated human pathways and 11 cancer hallmark networks, each of which is an aggregation of between 3 and 18 pathway models categorized by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) (https://cptac.wikipathways.org/).

Drawing on the Pathway Figure OCR open science project (Hanspers et al. 2020), NDEx IQuery includes a collection of 32263 gene sets defined by published pathway figures

INDRA GO. We used the INDRA system to assemble the output of multiple automated literature mining systems (Valenzuela-Esc√°rcega et al. 2018) (which were run via INDRA on PubMed abstracts and PubMedCentral full-text articles to extract regulation and interaction among biological entities) with the content of structured pathway knowledge bases including Pathway Commons (Rodchenkov et al. 2019)
