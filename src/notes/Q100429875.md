# Highlights

RNA endowed with both protein-coding and noncoding functions is referred to as ‘dual-function RNA’, ‘binary functional RNA (bifunctional RNA)’ or ‘cncRNA (coding and noncoding RNA)’. Recently, an increasing number of cncRNAs have been identified, including both translated ncRNAs (ncRNAs with coding functions) and untranslated mRNAs (mRNAs with noncoding functions). However, an appropriate database for storing and organizing cncRNAs is still lacking

Here, we developed cncRNAdb (http://www.rna-society.org/cncrnadb/), a manually curated database of experimentally supported cncRNAs, which aims to provide a resource for efficient manipulation, browsing and analysis of cncRNAs.


the translated ncRNAs was further divided into 6 subcategories: lncRNAs, pri-miRNAs, circRNAs, sRNAs, rRNAs and untranslated regions (UTRs).
