# Highlights

In addition to evaluating our model on existing datasets that focus
on named entities, we create a new dataset that
links noun phrases from WikiHow to Wikidata.
We show that our SumMC model achieves stateof-the-art unsupervised performance on our
new dataset and on existing datasets.

Previous research has
tackled this problem by learning EL models without data labeled entity links, but requires indirect
supervision in the form of textual descriptions attached to entities in KBs


Thus, we focus on fully unsupervised EL, which only has access to the entitiesâ€™
names and their KB relations like subclass-of
(Le and Titov, 2019; Arora et al., 2021).

We use zero-shot GPT-3 prompting
for two sub-tasks. First, we perform guided summarization, which summarizes the input document
conditioned on the target mention and outputs a
condensed global context. Then, we cast EL to
a multiple-choice selection problem where the
model chooses an entity from a list of candidates.
We refer to our unsupervised EL model as SumMC
(Summarization+Multiple-Choice).


Most work on EL has targeted named entities, especially in the news. To account for more diverse entities in different styles of texts, we create a humanannotated dataset called WikiHow-Wikidata that
links noun phrases in procedural texts to Wikidata.
