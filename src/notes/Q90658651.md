# Highlights

We used single-cell RNA sequencing to resolve the spatiotemporal immune topology of
the human kidney. We reveal anatomically defined expression patterns of immune genes
within the epithelial compartment, with antimicrobial peptide transcripts evident in pelvic
epithelium in the mature, but not fetal, kidney.

The principal infec-
tious challenge arises from bacteria ascending
the ureter into the kidney pelvis, and we have
previously shown that the hypersaline environment within the medulla may promote anti-microbial responses (3).

: yolk sac progenitors, aorta-gonad-meso-
nephros (AGM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs),
and fetal liver HSCs (9, 10)

ithin the myeloid compartment, we iden-
tified four distinct clusters of MNPs (Fig. 3B
and fig. S13, A to D). MNPs comprise monocytes,
macrophages, and DCs, with several subsets de-
scribed on the basis of surface markers, function,
and ontogeny (17).
