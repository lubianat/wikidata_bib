# Highlights
ches. In the context of clinical conditions causing anosmia, the current view of adult olfactory neurogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and failures in these processes is considered, along with current and future treatment strategies.

Axons from OSNs exit the base of the OE and their fascicles project as the first cranial nerve (CN I) through the cribriform plate to synapse in the olfactory bulbs.

Of the estimated several million neurons lining the olfactory cleft, there exist approximately 350 functionally distinct “types” of OSNs in humans, scattered in broad zones, with each “type” of neuron defined by its expression of one specific OR gene from a repertoire of 350 possible genes

<!-- Arguments for hundreds of types! -->

The human olfactory bulb bears the same general laminar organization seen in commonly studied animal models, however it does appear to differ in some respects from rodents.14 In humans, the olfactory bulb has, on average, over 5000 glomeruli, such that there is a high ratio of convergence of glomeruli/OSNs innervating them, indicating that complex initial odor coding occurs at this tissue


However, there is some evidence from fate mapping studies that neural crest intermixing with placode may also contribute to a subset of OE cells.37 Of interest, the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-expressing neurons that migrate during development from the olfactory placode region to the hypothalamus arise from neural crest. A developmental failure involving GnRH neurons leads to Kallmann syndrome, or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with anosmia, with defects in development of the olfactory bulb and the GnRH cell population.
