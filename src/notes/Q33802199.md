# Highlights
We present a detailed analysis of the quantity of hidden knowledge produced by an LBD system and the
effect of various filtering approaches upon this. The investigation of filtering combined with single or multi-step
linking term chains is carried out on all articles in PubMed.


Without filtering, large scale LBD becomes computa-
tionally difficult and the resulting hidden knowledge can
be practically unusable.

The LBD system described above relies on the exis-
tence of a relation between a pair of terms. We base
our relations on the output of the SemRep system
[17] which uses underspecified syntactic processing and
UMLS [9] domain knowledge to extract subject-relation-
object triples (such as X-treats-Y or X-affects-Y ) from
biomedical texts.

The UMLS Semantic Network contains a hierarchy of
subject categories, semantic types ( ST s), with at least
one assigned to each CUI. Previous work selects a num-
ber of ST s allowed to act as linking or target terms as
these are thought to describe the type of desired hid-
den knowledge; for example Yetisgen-Yildiz and Pratt
[8] allow both linking and target terms to be chemi-
cals & drugs and genes & molecular sequences, but link-
ing terms can also be disorders, physiology and anatomy
members.
