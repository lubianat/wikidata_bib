# Highlights

We conclude that from a medical and veterinary perspective, a combination of the ‘haematophagous arthropod’ and ‘mobility’ definitions is most useful because it offers important insights into contact structure and control and emphasizes the opportunities for pathogen shifts among taxonomically similar species with similar feeding modes and internal environments. From a population dynamics and evolutionary perspective, we suggest that a combination of the ‘micropredator’ and ‘sequential’ definition is most appropriate because it captures the key aspects of transmission biology and fitness consequences for the pathogen and vector itself. However, we explicitly recognize that the value of a definition always depends on the research question under study.

We first review some of the most common uses of the term (summarized in figure 1a and table 1), a number of which we immediately dismiss, either because we believe they are too broad or too narrow to be of practical use. We then consider in more detail which definitions are most appropriate for different contexts, and which aspects of host–pathogen–vector biology are most important when considering the most appropriate definition of a vector.

Some authors have gone further and extended the definition to include fomites (the biological + physical definition; definition #1)—inanimate objects capable of carrying infectious material and transferring it between hosts, such as syringes [20] and paper money [21]. Although it seems incongruous to group fomites together with biological agents of transmission, which can experience strong ecological and evolutionary interactions with the pathogen, from a public health perspective this definition may be relevant to disease management and prevention. 

One of the most obvious definitions is based on the recognition that most organisms we commonly recognize as being ‘vectors’ are hosts that transmit a pathogen while feeding non-lethally upon the internal fluids of another host. Largely this definition overlaps with the micropredator classification proposed by Lafferty & Kuris [24, p. 509], defined as ‘a natural enemy [that] attacks more than one victim…and does not necessarily eliminate its fitness’ (definition #3)

One advantage of this definition is that it clearly differentiates a vector from an intermediate host (such as Biomphalaria water snails within the Schistosoma transmission cycle), where definitive and intermediate host fitnesses are not directly affected by each other.

A related definition is the haematophagous arthropod definition (definition #4), which defines vectors only as blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, tsetse flies and biting midges [25]. Such arthropods generally also fall within the micropredator definition above, with the exception of species that feed on only a single host in their entire lifetime, such as louse flies (Hippoboscidae) and one-host ticks (such as Rhipicephalus microplus). 

This definition is used explicitly by several groups including the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [26] and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [27], and other sources either implicitly adopt this definition [28,29] or explicitly cite a broader definition but go on to discuss only examples falling under this definition [30]. 

As we have seen above, and summarized in figure 1, multiple definitions of vector are in common use. We suggest that the broadest definitions (e.g. the biological + physical definition) de-emphasize potentially critical differences between superficially similar vectors, for example insects and ticks [35], or encourage over-simplification of the interactions between vectors and pathogens.

, the intersection of the ‘haematophagous arthropod’ (#4) and ‘mobility’ (#6) definitions are the most useful from a medical and veterinary perspective (figure 1b)

More broadly, it implies that the theoretical frameworks needed to describe vector–pathogen (co-)evolutionary dynamics differ from those needed for pathogen–intermediate host dynamics. Also from the evolutionary perspective, ‘vector shifts’ between insect- and tick-borne transmission occur with some frequency, and this is probably facilitated by similar feeding mode and internal environments (from the perspective of the pathogens or parasites) such as antiviral responses, whereas the mobility of a putative vector is far less important. A useful definition from the evolutionary perspective should therefore reflect this.
