# Highlights
Just how related are reptilian and mammalian brains? Tosches et al. used single-cell transcriptomics to study turtle, lizard, mouse, and human brain samples

Gene expression data can help reconstruct the
evolution of brain regions and cell types (4, 5).
Here we used single-cell transcriptomics to study
the evolution of neuronal diversity in the amniote telencephalon.


) Are there reptilian cortical neurons homologous to mammalian hippocampal neurons? (iii)

We also associated glutamatergic clusters to anatomically defined pallial
regions in lizard (fig. S9). Corresponding regions
in lizard and turtle have different relative sizes
(for example, lizard anterior dorsal cortex is small)
but are clearly delineated by the expression of the
same developmental transcription factors such as
ZBTB20, SATB1, DACH2, and ETV1 (ER81) (Fig.
2D). These data define the molecular regionalization of the adult reptilian pallium
