# Highlights
data resource managers, and other
stakeholders recognised the need to identify and
prioritize a set of Global Core Biodata Resources,
thereby allowing the funding agencies to understand
which biodata resources are crucial for the larger
infrastructure and develop strategies to coordinate
stable funding across those crucial resources.

The GBC has been able to build on the prior efforts
by ELIXIR to define Core Data Resources supported
within Europe
4
(Durinx et al 2017), and this has
facilitated the development of the concept at the
global level.

Global Core Biodata Resources are characterised
according to multiple quantitative and qualitative
indicators that fall into five categories (Durinx et al.,
2017):

rating in the
context of a GCBR as defined by the GBC at this time,
unless it:
● forms an essential component of the
worldwide fundamental infrastructure of
biological, life science and biomedical data
resources,

serves a broad cross-section of research
fields, and
● fulfils a purpose towards the long-term
preservation of raw or aggregated data
internationally.
Examples of data resources that will not meet the
criteria for selection as a Global Core Biodata
Resource include:
● early-stage data resources that are primarily
used by those who established them,
● data resources that are targeted at a
specific research question or scientific field
and consequently used by a narrow sector
of the research landscape, or
● data resources established to store and
represent data results from a specific,
time-limited research project


Applications will be made in two steps:
1. Expressions of Interest: Biodata resources
will submit an expression of interest
statement built on a specified template that
ensures fulfilment of basic Eligibility Criteria
and poses Short Answer questions based on
the five categories of indicators for GCBR
selection. The expressions of interest will be
assessed by a review committee and those
selected will be invited to proceed to the
full application.
2. Full Application: Those biodata resources
shortlisted in the expression of interest step
will proceed to a full application including
detailed questions about the complete set
of 23 indicators used in GCBR selection. The
full applications will undergo review, with
the review committee having the task of
deciding which data resources they
recommend to be included in the initial list
of GCBRs. The GBC Board of Funders will
make the final formal decision on the list of
GCBRs, based on the review committee's
recommendation
<!-- Shoul Wikidata be a a Core Biodata resource? -- I think so, but it would need a dedicated person -->
ubmitting a full application will be a
time-consuming effort for the data resource
managers and Principal Investigators who will
shoulder that task. The more lightweight process of
completing an expression of interest form will
necessarily alert potential applicants to the rigour of
the process upon which they may be embarking, so
if they choose to continue they do so from a position
of being well informed.

In all these activities, the GBC and the GCBRs will
take a global perspective, and work to foster data
resources throughout the world. While the focus of
this document is the definition of the initial set of
Global Core Biodata Resources, the principles
established in and as a consequence of the selection
process should be understood to be aspirational, and
inspire good practice and optimal adoption of the
FAIR principles across the data landscape.

In pursuing these aims, the GBC does not in itself
function as a funding agency and will not provide
direct funding to support biodata resources. Rather,
the GBC serves to identify and illuminate the
requirements for long term sustainability of the
biological data landscape, working alongside data
resource managers and the scientists the data
resources serve, to fulfill its aims. A Letter of
Understanding
3 describes the rationale, aims,
scientific activities and governance of the GBC.# Comments
