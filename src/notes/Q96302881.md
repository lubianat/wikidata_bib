# Highlights
However, the wide adoption of whole-genome sequencing also poses new challenges for public-health agencies that must adapt to support a new set of expertise, which means that the capacity to perform genomic data assembly and analysis has not expanded as widely as the adoption of sequencing itself

Standardizing how data are recorded facilitates programmatic interaction with databases, enabling users to automate quality control and analytic procedures. Two good examples of epidemiologic ontologies are the Integrated Rapid Infectious Disease Analysis genomic epidemiology ontology, GenEpiO (https://genepio.org/) and FoodOn12.

Beyond recruitment, public-health programs should consider retraining as a way to build this workforce. Increasingly, laboratory microbiologists are pivoting towards more bioinformatics-heavy roles, often by learning these new skills on their own. With their incredible wealth of knowledge about the upstream sequencing process, former microbiologists have a unique perspective that could improve troubleshooting and evaluation of bioinformatics analyses. Bioinformatics training programs now exist across resource settings—for example, H3ABioNet (https://www.h3abionet.org/), ELIXIR-Tess (https://tess.elixir-europe.org/), GOBLET (https://www.mygoblet.org/) and Australian BioCommons (https://www.biocommons.org.au/training)—and these could serve as models for public-health bioinformatics training.
