# Highlights
Cells with similar functions, or cell types, in different animal species are related both by an evolutionary line of descent—similar to the relatedness of species themselves—and by a developmental line of descent in the embryo. 

Networks of interacting genes, or gene regulatory networks, control gene expression in the cell, thereby specifying cell type identity.


Among animal species, cell types vary greatly in terms of number and kind. The number of cell types found within an organism differs considerably between species, and cell type diversity is a significant contributor to differences in organismal structure and function. These observations suggest that cell type origination is a significant source of evolutionary novelty.


We propose that rewiring of cellular stress responses was an important mechanism for the evolution of the eutherian decidual cell type.
