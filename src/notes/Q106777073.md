# Highlights

We developed Quickomics, a feature-rich R Shiny-powered tool to enable biologists to fully explore complex omics statistical analysis results and perform advanced analysis in an easy-to-use interactive interface

Researchers can experience the functionalities with their own data or demo RNA-Seq and proteomics datasets by using the app hosted at http://quickomics.bxgenomics.com

Supplementary materials are available at https://bit.ly/37HP17g. 

Several tools allowing interactive exploration and visualization of complex omics data for end-users without program-ming  skills

To address these gaps, we developed Quickomics, an easy-to-use tool for the visualization of omics (mainly RNA-Seq and proteomics) data and statistical analysis results by leveraging newly developed R packages and modern  JavaScript  plotting  libraries  to  enhance  the  usability  from  data quality control to generation of publication-ready figures.
