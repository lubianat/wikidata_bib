Human Cell Atlas Ontology
=========================
  
  [@wikidata:Q112117012]  
  

# Highlights
We present the Human Cell Atlas Ontology
(HCAO), an application ontology that builds and extends from
existing ontology standards to provide terminology standards
with well-defined semantics for describing experimental data
coming into the HCA to ensure the data is interoperable and
amenable to integrative analysis.

The HCA Ontology (HCAO) is a dedicated application
ontology developed for the annotation of HCA metadata with
terms from relevant domain ontologies. We have developed a
pipeline for the automated construction of the HCAO that
builds from reference source ontologies to provide a core
subset of terms relevant for HCA data
