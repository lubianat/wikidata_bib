# Highlights

CellSim is a novel tool for the similarity calculation of different cells based on cell ontology and molecular networks in over 2000 different human cell types and presents sharing regulation networks of part cells.

CellSim can also calculate cell types by entering a list of genes, including more than 250 human normal tissue specific cell types and 130 cancer cell types. The results are shown in both tables and spider charts which can be preserved easily and freely.

Cell type and tissue specificity are key aspects of precision medicine and regenerative medicine researches [1].The cells direct reprogramming and complex human disease studies, such as cancer, show that cell-cell interaction networks and cell-specific regulatory differences are essentialfor researchers [2, 3].

The networks of cell types were downloaded and analyzed from Cell Ontology which includes 2160 cell types(Including both general and branch cell types). The similarity score between different cells was calculated by semantic similarity algorithm [25,26,27,28], with formula as below:

CellSim is a user-friendly and open-source software for the similarity calculation of different cells and the prediction of cell types based on networks which include the structure in Cell Ontology and the cell-specific TF-gene regulation network in FANTOM.
