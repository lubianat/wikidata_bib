# Highlights
 We applied four rule mining algorithms to the most common structuredmetadata elements (sample type, molecular type, platform, label type and organism) from over 1.3 mil-lion GEO records. We examined the quality of well supported rules from each algorithm and visualizedthe dependencies among metadata elements. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the algorithmsin terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. We found that PART is the best algorithm outper-forming Apriori, Predictive Apriori, and Decision Table.

 The largest database of geneexpression studies, the GEO microarray database, contains 50,000studies, over 1.3 million samples, and is still growing


 We  used  the‘‘GEOmetadb” package[27]in R[28]to query and obtain the meta-data for microarray experiments

 We have shown that predicting metadata using ARM algorithmsis possible using an existing large biomedical database such asGEO. Future work will focus on expanding this application to otherdatabases such as Biosample datasets (e.g. SRA), more comprehen-sive metadata as well as aggregation with other models from ourprevious works on both structured and unstructured metadata
