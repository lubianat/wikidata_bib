# Highlights

PubTator Central (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator/) is a web service for viewing and retrieving bioconcept annotations in full text biomedical articles. PubTator Central (PTC) provides automated annotations from state-of-the-art text mining systems for genes/proteins, genetic variants, diseases, chemicals, species and cell lines, all available for immediate download.
Third-party researchers have used PubTator in a variety of use cases, including biocuration support (11–13), gene prioritization (14,15), genetic disease analysis (16), literature-based knowledge discovery (17,18) and downstream text mining (7,19–24).

--> PubTator Central, reference for - 3.2.2.1. ANN

Annotations in PTC are available in multiple formats (XML, JSON and tab delimited) via the online interface, a RESTful web service or FTP download. PTC is synchronized with PubMed and PMC-TM, with new articles added daily.

In future work, we intend to improve the search function to allow keyword and semantic queries to be combined. We also intend to include additional concept types (e.g. anatomical entities such as cellular components, cell types and tissues) and to improve the accuracies of the concept taggers in full text, especially in areas with minimal textual context, such as tables and supplementary material (52)

--> Tagging of cell type by Pub Tator Central needs - 1.3.1.4. Cell Ontology (and CELDA)
