# Highlights

The realm of pathological entities can be subdivided into pathological
dispositions, pathological processes, and pathological structures. The latter are the
bearer of dispositions, which can then be realized by their manifestations —
pathologic processes.


We describe an ontology design pattern which allows ontologists to make
assertions that blur the distinctions between dispositions, processes, and structures
until necessary

We defend a judicious use of disjunctive, and therefore ambiguous,
classes in biomedical ontologies during the process of ontology construction and in
the practice of ontology application. The use of these classes is permitted to span
across several top-level categories, provided it contributes to ontology simplification
and supports the intended reasoning scenarios.

Current biomedical ontologies and terminology systems subscribe to diverging and
partly contradicting concepts regarding diseases. Diseases have often been categorized
as processes, events, or states [1]; 

From the medical perspective, the term “disease”implies some aspect
of delimitation and classification. This comes close to the definition in the Webster’s
dictionary [8], where disease is defined as “a condition of the living animal or plant
body or of one of its parts that impairs normal functioning and is typically manifested
by distinguishing signs and symptoms“, whereas disorder is just an “an abnormal physi-
cal or mental condition“
