# Highlights



The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD; https://card.mcmaster.ca) is a curated resource providing reference DNA and protein sequences, detection models and bioinformatics tools on the molecular basis of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR

Here, we describe updates and recent expansions to CARD and its biocuration process, including new resources for community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.

We here describe (i) the expanded biocuration of reference sequences and mutation data in CARD, (ii) expansion of CARD’s Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO) to include terms for harmonization of AMR phenotypic assays, (iii) in silico surveillance of pathogen resistomes and sequence variants, (iv) new tools for classification of reference data and genome annotation results and (v) new efforts toward community biocuration of AMR molecular reference data.

3 Custom relationships for CARD used by ARO but not yet included in the Relations Ontology.

confers_resistance_to_drug_class 	Pending3 	A relationship wherein the subject class A confers or contributes to antibiotic resistance to drug class B (formerly confers_resistance_to) 


Overall, CARD’s primary curation paradigm is as follows: to be included in CARD an AMR determinant must be described in a peer-reviewed scientific publication, with its DNA sequence available in GenBank, including clear experimental evidence of elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) over controls

In response to the 2019 European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) AMR Databases Workshop, we have established the ‘AMR_Curation’ public repository for collective curation of AMR genes and mutations involving the majority of AMR database curators (e.g. NCBI, Resfinder, MEGARes, etc.) with an active and monitored curation issue tracker, a parallel AMR curation mailing list, editable Google Spreadsheet List of AMR Databases and Software, and curated Wikipedia list of AMR Databases all accessible at https://github.com/arpcard/amr_curation.
