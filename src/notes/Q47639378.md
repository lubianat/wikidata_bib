# Highlights

Now celebrating its 10th anniversary online, CAZypedia is a successful example of dynamic, community-driven and expert-based biocuration. CAZypedia is an open-access resource available at URL 

In keeping with its primary function to list individual family members, family pages in the CAZy database are efficiently minimalistic. CAZypedia arose from the idea that a more detailed and directly accessible summary of the key research on individual CAZy families would be of significant value to glycoscience researchers, particularly highlighting the primacy of key research discoveries in a family, and supporting the activities of all scientists interested in CAZymes.

CAZypedia’s roots can be traced to renowned polysaccharide biochemist Professor Bruce Stone (1928–2008†; Whelan 2009) who proposed the idea of a comprehensive encyclopedia of the CAZymes. 

Inspired by the growing impact of Wikipedia as a community-based publishing model of encyclopedic information, the idea to use a wiki (see definition at URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki).

CAZypedia pages may be beneficially embellished with figures, although this is optional. 

Thus, although CAZypedia adopts many of the general principles and rules of Wikipedia, CAZypedia draws on best-practice authoring and editing principles of peer-reviewed, wiki-based encyclopedia such as Citizendium (available at URL http://en.citizendium.org/) and Scholarpedia (available at URL http://www.scholarpedia.org)

Following the Citizendium model, transparency is achieved through the use of contributors’ real names in CAZypedia. Additionally, individual biographical pages enable readers to evaluate directly each contributor’s expertise in the field.
