# Highlights

A single parasite transcription factor
drives the differentiation of Toxoplasma
to a cyst-forming stage to sustain chronic
infection.

Acute-stage tachyzoites
differentiate into chronic-stage bradyzoites, which
form intracellular cysts resistant to immune clearance and existing therapies. The molecular basis of
this differentiation is unknown, despite being
efficiently triggered by stresses in culture. 


Chronic stages play important roles in the life cycles of many
pathogens within the phylum Apicomplexa. Plasmodium vivax
hypnozoites in the liver are resistant to many antimalarial therapies, leading to long periods of latency followed by the patent
infection, complicating eradication efforts (Baird, 2009). Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites are capable of invading any nucleated
cell of warm-blooded animals, disseminating throughout the
body and causing pathology through lysis of host cells.
