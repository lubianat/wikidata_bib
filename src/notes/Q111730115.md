# Highlights

 All cell images in SwissBioPics are drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), with each subcellular location tagged with a unique identifier from the controlled vocabulary of subcellular locations and organelles of UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org/locations/). Users can search and explore SwissBioPics cell images through our website, which provides a platform for users to learn more about how cells are organized. 

 The UniProt website now uses SwissBioPics to visualize the subcellular locations and organelles where proteins function. SwissBioPics is freely available for anyone to use under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

 The image library of SwissBioPics, available for download at www.swissbiopics.org, currently includes images for 48 different cell types from all kingdoms of life. There are 24 types of bacterial and archaeal cells, including cells with single or double membranes (Gram+ and Gram−) and covering morphologies as diverse as cocci, rods, spirals, commas and clubs.
