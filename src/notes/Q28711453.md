# Highlights

. To close this gap and better understand all aspects of literature curation, we invited submissionsof written descriptions of curation workflows from expert curated databases for the BioCreative 2012 Workshop Track II.We received seven qualified contributions, primarily from model organism databases. Based on these descriptions, weidentified commonalities and differences across the workflows, the common ontologies and controlled vocabularies usedand the current and desired uses of text mining for biocuration.
