# Highlights
Here, an assessment of the immune landscape in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of two TNBC mouse models has been performed using single-cell RNA sequencing technology.

TNBC is believed to be an immunogenic BC subtype, but it is currently unclear which cell populations are involved in the immune response within the TME during specific conditions as well as their proportion in specific treatments [18].

Cell-type annotation
The SingleR package [33] in combination with the ImmGen() reference transcriptome dataset [34], containing 253 fine labels generated from 830 microarray samples of sorted cell populations, was used for automatic cell type assignment. 
We inspected the confidence of the predicted labels using the delta values: the difference between the score for the assigned label and the median across all labels for each cell. Using the PruneScores() function, we marked potentially poor-quality or ambiguous assignments based on the delta valu
e. Moreover, we uniformed the label name of the ImmGen() dataset according to the wanted level of resolution by using the cell ontology label present in the Celldex package [33]. For example, two of the several Cd4 T cell labels were T.CD4.24H (CL:0000624) and T.CD4.CTR (CL:0000624), therefore, we searched for the cell ontology label in Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) repository (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl) and established “T cells Cd4” as a common label. We verified the assignment using two procedures: (i) exploring the expression of known cell gene markers; ii) evaluating the top differential expressed genes (DEG) between cell clusters on PanglaoDB [35].
