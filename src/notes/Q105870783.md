# Highlights

In this paper we present a publicly avail-able   resource   distributing   preprocessedbiomedical  literature  including  sentencesplitting, tokenization, part-of-speech tag-ging,  syntactic  parses  and  named  entityrecognition.   The  aim  of  this  work  is  tosupport  the  future  development  of  large-scale text mining resources by eliminatingthe time consuming but necessary prepro-cessing steps

Both   PubMed   XML   articles   and   PMCOANXML full texts are preprocessed using publiclyavailable tools2(Pyysalo et al., 2013). 

We  have  introduced  a  new  resource  which  pro-vides  the  basic  linguistic  analyses,  essential  inthe development of text mining knowledge bases,for  the  whole  of  PubMed  and  PubMed  CentralOpen Access section, thus drastically reducing theamount of required preprocessing efforts.

# Comments

One more processing, cool, but not core to me.
