# Highlights

A protocol for human liver dissociation for scRNA-seq.Acentral problem in liver tissue dissociation is that hepatocytes and cholangiocytes are sensitive to cell death, and other cells activate,in response to cell manipulation

--> - 1.4.2.1.1 Bias introduced by different scRNA-seq methods

non-parenchymal  cells(NPCs)

neurologically deceased donors (NDD).


s. Preliminary scRNA-seq experi-ments showed an under-representation of NPC cell populationsin the sorted NPC-enriched fraction compared to total liverhomogenate (TLH) (S

We appliedour liver single-cell dissociation protocol and scRNA-seq tech-nology to identify resident liver cells in TLHs from NDD livertransplant donors

dHeat map analysis using known gene expression profiles of hepatocytes/immune cells. The identity of each cluster was assigned by matching the cluster expression profile with established cell-specific marker gene expression forhepatocytes, endothelial cells, cholangiocytes, and immune cells

We found six distinct hepatocytepopulations, comprising Clusters 1, 3, 5, 6, 14, and 15 (Figs.2f,4ci), that were generally less proliferative cells (Figs.2e,4a), andshowed enrichedALB(Albumin) expression, a hallmark ofhepatocytes.To directly infer hepatocyte cluster zonation patterns, single-molecule FISH (smFISH) and laser capture microdissectionstudies are required, these techniques were not a part of thisstudy.

--> Cool. Oh , not a part. Not cool. But cool anyways liver zonation info s: 2.4.7.5 Differentia for cell classes: sub-organ regions


The authors were able to identify three clustersof hepatic cells (hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and KCs

Confounding factors to be considered when interpreting thedata in this study are that while the caudate lobes obtained werefrom clinically acceptable, healthy liver grafts, these NDD livergrafts are mildly inflamed23
