# Highlights

Weiss et al.1 identify a transcriptional program found at acral sites that primes pigment-producing cells called melanocytes to form tumours if they undergo specific genomic alterations. These data point to cells’ positional identities — described by the authors as the transcriptional program unique to particular anatomical sites — as being a key determinant of the ability of melanocytes to give rise to different subtypes of melanoma.

Melanocytes can potentially form tumours at any site at which they reside, including cutaneous or acral sites, in the pigmented tissues of the eye and on the internal surfaces (mucosal sites) lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts.

The authors examined DNA-sequencing data for selected clinically relevant genes, and studied the RNA-expression profiles of tumours in people with acral or cutaneous melanoma.

Weiss et al. engineered zebrafish to express CRKL and GAB2 specifically in melanocytes. The authors also manipulated these melanocytes so that they expressed the TERT protein and lacked expression of NF1 protein, two characteristics that are often a hallmark of human acral melanomas
