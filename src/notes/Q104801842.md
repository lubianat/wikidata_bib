# Highlights


e used a computational method (Population-Specific Expression Analysis; PSEA) to decompose gene expression in gingival tissues into cell type-
specific signatures for eight cell types (epithelial cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neutrophils,
monocytes/macrophages, plasma cells, T cells and B cells).


Collectively, our
results demonstrate the robustness of the PSEA in the decomposition of gingival tissue
transcriptomes, and its ability to identify differentially regulated transcripts in particular cellular
constituents. These genes may serve as candidates for further investigation with respect to their
roles in the pathogenesis of periodontitis
