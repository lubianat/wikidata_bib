# Highlights
We evaluate the effectiveness of link prediction through a series of experiments using a MeSH network that contains the history of link formation between biomedical concepts. We performed link prediction using proximity measures, such as common neighbor (CN), Jaccard coefficient (JC), Adamic / Adar index (AA) and preferential attachment (PA).

We mimic the process of LBD as a classification problem on a graph of MeSH terms.
