# Highlights
The NAR online Molecular Biology Database Collection has been updated, reviewing 138 entries, adding 88 new resources and eliminating 47 discontinued URLs, bringing the current total to 1737 databases. It is available at http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/c/.

Metabolic pathways are covered by the well-known returning databases Reactome (33) and WikiPathways (34). The former update is notable for its Enhanced High Level Diagrams which superbly contextualise low-level pathways using images of cells, tissues and organs. Among enzyme-oriented databases

The Virus Taxonomy (44) appears in NAR for the first time, despite the International Committee behind it dating back to the 1960s.

We reach this year the 25th update of the NAR online Molecular Biology Database Collection (which is freely available at http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/c/), featuring 88 new databases (Table 1) and 15 databases not described previously in the NAR Database Issue (Table 2).
