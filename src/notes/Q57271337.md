# Highlights
  SciCrunch was designed to break down the traditional types of portal silos created by different communities, so that communities can take advantage of work done by others and share their expertise as well.  When a community brings in a data source, it becomes available to other communities, thus ensuring that valuable resources are shared by other communities who might need them.


  To ensure proper credit and to help share expertise, all resources are tagged by the communities that create them and those that access them.


  SciCrunch Registry â€“ is a curated catalog of thousands of research resources (data, tools, materials, services, organizations, core facilities),
