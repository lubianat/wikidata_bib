# Highlights
Suppression of neuronal activation by microglia occurs in a highly region-specific fashion and depends on the ability of microglia to sense and catabolize extracellular ATP, which is released upon neuronal activation by neurons and astrocytes

Microglial sensing of ATP, the ensuing microglia-dependent production of adenosine, and the adenosine-mediated suppression of neuronal responses via the adenosine receptor A1R are essential for the regulation of neuronal activity and animal behaviour.

The pro-convulsive effect of the D1 agonist depends on the downstream PKA–DARPP32–ERK signalling pathway, which increases neuronal firing frequency and is likely to involve the recurrent activation of striato-thalamo-cortical neuronal circuits


Thus, loss of Il34 has no overall effect on neuron or glia phenotypes (Extended Data Fig. 5j–l) in the striatum, and the abnormal hyper-responsiveness of neurons in the absence of local microglia is not a consequence of Il34 deficiency (Extended Data Fig. 5).
