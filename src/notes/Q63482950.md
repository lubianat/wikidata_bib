# Highlights

Crowdsourced knowledge bases like Wikidata suffer from lowquality edits and vandalism, employing machine learning-based
approaches to detect both kinds of damage. We reveal that stateof-the-art detection approaches discriminate anonymous and new
users: benign edits from these users receive much higher vandalism scores than benign edits from older ones, causing newcomers to
abandon the project prematurely. We address this problem for the first time by analyzing and measuring the sources of bias, and by
developing a new vandalism detection model that avoids them

For example, benign edits of new users receive vandalism scores over 300 times higher than benign
edits of older user accounts

We evaluate our approaches on a subset of the standardized, large-scale Wikidata Vandalism Detection Corpus 2016 [27],
comparing our results to others from the literature


Vandalism at Wikipedia is defined as “editing deliberately intended to obstruct or defeat the project’s purpose.”3 Though this
definition excludes damage caused unintentionally, the task of a vandalism detector, human or other, is to identify both kinds of damage
so they can be dealt with according to severity. 

vandalism detection models for Wikidata are still in their infancy [25, 27, 43, 49, 52],
as evidenced by the facts that their feature sets are almost entirely
the same as those employed for Wikipedia, and that hardly any
feature quantifies Wikidata’s actual content, i.e., the knowledge
encoded as subject-predicate-object triples

. Our approach omits the
biased user reputation features and introduces novel graph embeddings, drawing from, and advancing related work on fact checking
and link prediction.

Wiktionary defines ‘discrimination’ as “treatment of an individual
or group to their disadvantage” and ‘bias’ as “inclination towards
something; predisposition, partiality, prejudice [. . . ].”
