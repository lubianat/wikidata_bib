# Highlights
‘‘Weighted nearest neighbor’’ analysis integrates multimodal
single-cell data
d A multimodal reference ‘‘atlas’’ of the circulating human
immune system

Here, we introduce ‘‘weighted-nearest neighbor’’ (WNN) analysis, an analytical framework to integrate multiple data types
measured within a cell and to obtain a joint definition of cellular state



For each cell, we began by independently calculating sets of
k = 20 nearest neighbors for each modality. We found that for
CD8+ T cells, the most similar RNA neighbors often reflected a
mix of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (in the RNA KNN graph, there
are a total of 944 incorrect edges that connect CD8+ to CD4+
T cells). By contrast, protein neighbors were predominantly
correctly identified as CD8+ T cells (in the protein KNN graph,
12 CD8+
/CD4+ edges were identified). This reflects the particular
utility of protein data when defining the state of these cells.

--> Interesting observation, biased conclusion


The WNN graph is a single representation of a multimodal dataset, but should more
accurately reflect the richness of both data types. For example,
the WNN graph contained only 20 CD8+
/CD4+ edges

assist the community in utilizing
our resource, we have created a web application, freely available at https://azimuth.hubmapconsortium.org/, which enables
users to rapidly map their own datasets online, automating the
process of visualization and annotation. Using this approach, a
dataset of 50,000 cells can be fully processed and mapped in
less than 5 min.
