Reproducible computational research (RCR)

Metadata provides context and provenance to raw data and methods and is essential to
both discovery and validation. Despite this shared connection with scientific data, few studies
have explicitly described the relationship between metadata and RCR. 

Our article provides background context, explores gaps, and discovers component trends of
embeddedness and methodology weight from which we derive recommendations for future
work.

Whitaker 8 describes an analysis as "reproducible" in the
narrow sense that a user can produce identical results provided the data and code from the
original, and "generalisable" if it produces similar results when both data is swapped out for
similar data ("replicability"), and if underlying code is swapped out with comparable

software development communities (Plan, Collect, Quality Control, Document, Preserve, Use).

- Metadata related to raw data and intermediates
- Metadata related to executable and script tools
-Literate statistical analysis documents in Jupyter or knitr

The usage of these ontologies appears to follow a steep Pareto distribution, with "Gene Ontology" garnering more than 20,000 term
mentions in PubMed, the vast majority of NCBO's 843 ontologies have never been cited or
mentioned.
One example of such an input metadata
framework is the Allotrope Data Format, an HDF5 data structure, and accompanying ontology
for chemistry protocols used in the pharmaceutical industry
102
. Allotrope uses the W3C Shapes
Constraint Language (SHACL) to describe which RDF relationships are valid to describe lab
operations.


The opacity, rapid proliferation, and multifaceted nature of
machine learning and data mining statistical methods to non-experts suggest it is necessary to
begin cataloguing and describing them at a more refined level than crude categories (e.g.
clustering, classification, regression, dimension reduction, feature selection). So far, the closest
attempt to decompose statistics in this manner is the STATO statistical ontology

Using this metadata, an important aspect of CWL is the focus on richly describing tool
invocations both for reproducibility and documentation purposes, with tools referenced as
retrievable Docker images or Conda packages, and identifiers to EDAM 60
, ELIXIRâ€™s bio.tools registry and Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs). This wrapping of command line tool
interfaces is used by GA4GH Dockstore for providing a uniform executable interface to a
large variety of computational tools even outside workflows
