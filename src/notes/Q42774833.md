# Highlights

Yet, unbiased evidence for CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures

Analysis of copy number variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.

There was significant variation between the microglia cells, with a set of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A, IL1B, IL8 and TNF), chemokines (CCL3, CCL4) and early response genes coordinately expressed by ~ 80% of the microglia (Extended Data Fig. 2b). 

our single-cell profiles suggest that oligodendroglioma stem/progenitor cells more closely resemble a primitive tri-potent neural cell type, such as NSC or NPC than a more committed glial progenitor like an OPC
