# Highlights

Here we describe sci-CAR, a combinatorial indexing–based coassay that jointly profiles chromatin accessibility and mRNA (CAR) in each of thousands of single cells.


As a proof of concept,
we apply sci-CAR to 4825 cells, including a time series of dexamethasone
treatment, as well as to 11,296 cells from the adult mouse kidney

We converted the ATAC-seq (cell-by-site) matrix
to a [cell-by–transcription factor (TF) motif] matrix,
simply by counting occurrences of each motif in
all accessible sites for each cell (20)

As a proof of concept,
we apply sci-CAR to 4825 cells, including a time series of dexamethasone
treatment, as well as to 11,296 cells from the adult mouse kidney

We identified 22,026 DA sites across the 14 mouse kidney cell types, 


(A) t-SNE visualization of mouse kidney
nuclei (RNA-seq). Cell types are assigned on the basis of established
marker genes. 

o quantify the utility
of the links between distal cis-regulatory elements
and their target genes identified from sci-CAR
data, we constructed a linear regression model
to predict gene expression differences based on
chromatin accessibility at promoters only versus
promoters together with linked distal site
