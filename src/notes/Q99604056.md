# Highlights

Choroidal all- trans -retinoic acid (atRA) may play a key role in the control of postnatal eye growth in a variety of vertebrates through modulation of scleral extracellular matrix synthesis and may therefore play a crucial role in the development of myopia. In the chick eye, choroidal atRA synthesis is exclusively regulated by its synthesizing enzyme, retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2)


Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the RALDH2+ cell type(s) in the choroid and determine how these cells modulate atRA concentrations during periods of visually guided eye growth.

 chick choroids, the vast majority of RALDH2+ cells co-expressed Col1-propetide, but did not co-label with any other antibodies tested. In human choroid, some, but not all RALDH2+ cells colocalized with vimentin, but were negative for all other antibodies tested
