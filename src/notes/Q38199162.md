# Highlights

 Since extensive and manually curated experimental data about NR ligands and structures are provided in the NRLiSt BDB, it should become a powerful tool to assess the performance of virtual screening methods on NRs, to assist the understanding of NRâ€™s function and modulation, and to support the discovery of new drugs targeting NRs. NRLiSt BDB is freely available online at http://nrlist.drugdesign.fr.

 To retrieve the ligands of each NR, we first used the ChEMBL database. (29) For each target of interest, the ChEMBL database proposed compounds that were classified according to their activity available in the literature. However, the information on the pharmacological profile of the ligands was not necessarily available, and we thus decided to manually retrieve all information about ligand binding and pharmacological profiles
