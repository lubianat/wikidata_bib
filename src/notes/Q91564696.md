# Highlights

Comparing human brain cortex samples profiled with or without hashingantibodies, we  demonstrate  that  nucleus  hashing  does  not significantly  alter recoveredprofiles. We develop DemuxEM, a computational tool that detects inter-sample multipletsand assigns singlets to their sample of origin, and validate its accuracy using sex-specific geneexpression, species-mixing and natural genetic variation. Our approach will facilitate tissueatlases of isogenic model organisms or from multiple biopsies or longitudinal samples of onedonor, and large-scale perturbation screens.

DemuxEM, acomputational tool using the Expectationâ€“Maximalization (EM)algorithm to remove multiplets from analysis and assign singletsto their sample of origin.

. DemuxEM is a computational tool wedeveloped that enables accurate multiplet detection, nucleusidentity assignment, and identification of the sources of ambienthashtag contamination
