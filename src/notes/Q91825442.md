# Highlights

This study was undertaken to systematically assess the utilities and performance of ontology-based semantic analysis in adverse outcome pathway (AOP) research. With an increasing number of AOPs developed by scientific domain experts to organize toxicity information and facilitate chemical risk assessment, there is a pressing need for objective approaches to evaluate the biological coherence and quality of these AOPs. 

With the events in the AOP-Wiki first annotated into logical definitions and then grouped into phenotypic profiles by individual AOPs, the coherence and quality of AOPs were assessed at several levels: paired key event relationships (KER), all possible event pair combinations within AOPs, and the phenotypic profiles of AOPs, genes, biological pathways, human diseases, and selected chemicals. 

s of February 2019, there were nearly 1000 KEs, more than 1100 key event relationships (KERs), and 200 plus AOPs in various stages of development deposited in the AOP-Wiki, a component of AOP Knowledgebase sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development

The events in the AOP-Wiki were first annotated into computable logical definitions. They were then merged with many OBO ontologies of relevance and reasoned into a unified common ontology, which is essentially a directed acyclic graph.
