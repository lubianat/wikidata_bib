# Highlights

In contrast to HER2-amplified primary breast cancer, which is highly sensitive to HER2-targeted therapy, the clinical significance of acquired HER2 heterogeneity during the evolution of metastatic breast cancer is unknown

Cultured CTCs maintain discrete HER2+ and HER2− subpopulations: HER2+ CTCs are more proliferative but not addicted to HER2,

 22 individual CTCs from two representative patients (Brx-42, Brx-82) were isolated and subjected to single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). HER2 expression was bimodal in distribution (≤ 1 read per million (RPM) vs median 133, range 32–217 RPM; p = 7.5e-6) (Fig. 1b), indicating the existence of discrete HER2+ and HER2− subpopulations. I

 To define the molecular characteristics of HER2+ vs HER2− CTCs, we quantitatively mapped the global proteomes (>6300 proteins) of FACS-purified subpopulations (Brx-42, Brx-82, Brx-142) 

 To explore the potential therapeutic significance of pathways differentially activated in HER2+ vs HER2− CTC subpopulations, we screened a panel of 55 drugs selected both for clinical relevance and ability to target MS-identified pathway

 The comparable tumor initiating potential and similar expression of stem cell marker ALDH1 in HER2+ and HER2− CTCs suggests underlying tumor cell plasticity in these advanced patient-derived breast CTC lines, rather than a hierarchical cancer stem cell model as described in drug resistant subpopulations within established breast cancer cell lines
