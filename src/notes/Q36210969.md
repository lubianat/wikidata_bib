# Highlights

This paper deals with a recent revision of the terminology of the Sections Central Nervous System (CNS; Systema  nervosum  centrale) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS; Systema nervosum  periphericum) of the TerminologiaAnatomica (TA, 1998) and the TerminologiaHistologica  (TH,  2008).

hroughout the document the subdivision of neurons proposed by Bota and Swanson (2007) is  used.  This  follows  the  Brain  Architecture  Management  System  (BAMS; http://brancusi.usc.edu/bkms), and includes sensory neurons, interneurons (short and long), and motoneuron

The description of the Morphologiainterna (internal features) of the cerebral cortex follows the embryological subdivision of the pallium into four parts. The Palliumdorsalegives rise to the isocortex or neocortex, the Palliumlaterale to the claustroinsular complex, the Palliummediale to the formatio hippocampi and the Palliumventrale to the olfactory cortex and the pallial amygdala. Where possible, neuron types are added, starting from the TH terminology.  Isocortical  neurons  are  subdivided  into  pyramidal  neurons  (projection, commissural and association) and excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. For the inhibitory, mainly GABAergic, interneurons, the Petilla (Cajal's birthplace) terminology is introduced (see DeFelipe et al., 2013).

What's next? Regular updating of the TNA will remain necessary to accommodate recent and future findings  in neuroscience.  Comments can be sent  to the  FIPAT  website at  Fribourg University, Switzerland (http://www.unifr.ch/ifaa) or to the corresponding author.
