# Highlights

o systematicallyanalyze miRNA expression in neurons, we haveestablished a miRNA tagging and affinity-purification(miRAP) method that is targeted to cell types throughthe Cre-loxP binary system in mice

-->  1.4.4. Types of knowledge about cell types: cell-type specific miRNAs
-->  2.4.2.2.1. Transgenic animals and marker-based identification

 Here, we present a novel miRNA tagging and affinity-purifica-tion method, miRAP, which can be applied to genetically definedcell types in any complex tissues in mice.

 We further established a Cre-loxp binary expres-sion system to deliver epitope-tagged AGO2 (tAGO2) to geneti-cally defined cell types.

 a knockinallele at theGt(ROSA)26Sor(Rosa26) locus which expressestAGO2  upon  Cre/loxp  recombination  (R26-LSL-tAGO2).Combined with an increasing inventory of cell type-restrictedCre driver lines (Taniguchi et al., 2011) this strategy would allowsystematic analysis of miRNA expression in different cell types inmice

 particular, the Ca2+-binding proteinparvalbumin (PV) and neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) marktwo major nonoverlapping subtypes (Gonchar et al., 2007; Xuet al., 2010b; Rudy et al., 2011). Whereas the PV interneuronsinnervate the soma and proximal dendrites and control theoutput and synchrony of pyramidal neurons, the SST interneu-rons innervate the more distal dendrites and control the inputand plasticity of pyramidal neurons (Somogyi et al., 1998; DiCristo et al., 2004)

 In our data set, the preferred arm largelyremained consistent across the cell and tissue types. However,a few miRNAs switched dominant arms in different libraries.For example, miR-544-3p was sequenced more frequently inPurkinje cell and cerebellum samples, while miR-544-5p wassequenced more frequently in the four neocortical cell samplesand neocortex tissue sample

-->  1.4.4. Types of knowledge about cell types: cell-type specific miRNAs arms that are processed

A necessary step toward understanding the regulatory functionof miRNAs in the brain is gaining a comprehensive knowledgeon their expression in the relevant cell types of the neural circuitsand in the relevant physiological and developmental processe
