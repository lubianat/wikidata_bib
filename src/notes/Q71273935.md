# Highlights

A new cell type, the antral clear cell, was discovered, which occupied a basal location between pylorus cells at different depths of the pyloric crypt and gland. Resting on the basement membrane, the irregularly shaped cell was distinguished prin- cipally by an electron lucid cytoplasm and a paucity of intracellular organelles

Pylorus cell 
The pyloric antrum of the ferret stomach is lined (Figs. 1, 2) by a columnar epi- thelium consisting almost entirely of mucus-secreting cells, the pylorus cells,


 cell of distinct morphology and previously undescribed character was discovered in the antrum of the ferret. This cell, which may best be termed, "clear cell", is easily distinguishable by the electron lucid nature of its cytoplasm (Figs. 2-4)

 Rarely, one to three large granules (0.34-0.55/~) bounded by a membrane, and of great electron density, can be observed in the centrosphere of this cell. Typically, however, the clear cell is void of "secretory" granules.
 
 The possibility exists that the antral clear cell is the source of gastrin, which is known to arise from the gastric antrum. urther studies are re- quired, however, before the exact function of the antral clear cell is proved, or before the cell types from which gastrin and gastric intrinsic factor arise, are clearly identified.
