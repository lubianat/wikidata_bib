# Highlights
Results: The Second BioCreative assessment (2006 to 2007) attracted 44 teams from 13 countries worldwide,
with the aim of evaluating current information-extraction/text-mining technologies developed for one or more
of the three tasks defined for this challenge evaluation. These tasks included the recognition of gene mentions in
abstracts (gene mention task); the extraction of a list of unique identifiers for human genes mentioned in abstracts
(gene normalization task); and finally the extraction of physical protein-protein interaction annotation-relevant
information (protein-protein interaction task). The 'gold standard' data used for evaluating submissions for the
third task was provided by the interaction databases MINT (Molecular Interaction Database) and IntAct

The Second BioCreative community challenge evaluation successfully promoted the development, evaluation, and monitoring of text-mining strategies applied to biologically
relevant tasks. This is reflected in the significant increase in
number of participating teams with respect to BioCreative I,
as well as in the collaboration with biological databases for
providing useful data collections.
