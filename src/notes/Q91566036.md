# Highlights

In recent years, researches focusing on PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have increased rapidly. It has been revealed that piRNAs have strong association with a wide range of diseases; thus, it becomes very important to understand piRNAs’ role(s) in disease diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of treatment response. We searched more than 2500 articles using keywords, such as `PIWI-interacting RNAs’ and `piRNAs’, and further scrutinized the articles to collect piRNAs-disease association data.

<!-- Nice! -->

The piRDisease (piRDisease v1.0) is a novel, comprehensive and exclusive database resource, which provides 7939 manually curated associations of experimentally supported 4796 piRNAs involved in 28 diseases.

After preprocessing, we categorized manually curated piRNAs’ disease association data in `annotation’ field based on experimental methods used in the reference studies.
