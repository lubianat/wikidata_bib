# Highlights

Here, we analyze the transcriptome of human primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the migrating stage to the gonadal stage at single-cell and single-base resolutions

Our work paves the way toward deciphering the complex epigenetic reprogramming of the germline with the aim of restoring totipotency in fertilized oocytes.

Interestingly, we found that human PGCs were much larger, in general, than the surrounding somatic cells in the gonads

. Interestingly, the six somatic cells at the AGM region of 4 week embryos clustered together with PGCs (Figure 1B). We analyzed these six cells and found that they expressed hematopoietic marker genes, such as MEIS1 and PBX1, and were probably hematopoietic precursor cells (Figure S1D)
