# Highlights
Germany's federal criminal office is to introduce a central DNA database for sex offenders, convicted murderers and others who commit serious crimes, including members of house-breaking rings. The minister of the interior, Manfred Kanther, approved the plan last week.

The move follows a series of largely unsolved sex killings of children in the past few months in Germany. Political pressure to introduce a DNA database grew particularly strong after the most recent case, the murder of a 13-year-old girl in Lower Saxony last month.
