# Highlights
We present an unsupervised concept extraction method for scientific literature that achieves much higher precision than previous work. Our approach relies on a simple but novel intuition: each scientific concept is likely to be introduced or popularized by a single paper that is disproportionately cited by subsequent papers mentioning the concept.
