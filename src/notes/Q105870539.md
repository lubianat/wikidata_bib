# Highlights

 We propose a cross-lingual neural rerankingmodel to match a UMLS concept with a Wikipedia page, which achieves a recall@1of72%, asubstantial improvement of20%over word- and char-level BM25, enabling manual alignmentwith minimal effort. We release our resources, including ranked Wikipedia pages for 700k UMLSconcepts, andWikiUMLS, a dataset for training and evaluation of alignment models betweenUMLS and Wikipedia collected from Wikidata.

 --> Hmm, tasty.

This language may not match Wikipedia titles exactly, makingsearch hard (and noisy).  Aligning UMLS and Wikipedia facilitates such information seeking,  makesmedical information accessible in a patientâ€™s native language, and supports the need for patient accessto information in consumer-friendlier terms (Zeng et al., 2001; Smith and Stavri, 2005)

owever, the text-based methodssuffer from non-comparable corpora (Ormazabal et al., 2019), and the KG methods have not been triedon Wikidata because of its large scale and entity variety.

WikiUMLSis  a  UMLS  to  Wikipedia  aligned  dataset  we  create  in  this  work.   It  consists  of  about17.8k UMLS concepts that are manually linked to their matching Wikipedia page by Wikipedia con-tent contributors.  All the UMLS concepts inWikiUMLSare from Medical Subject Headings vocab-ulary (MeSH) (Lipscomb, 2000).

We proposed passage pair ranking models based on pretrained contextual encodings for aligning UMLSand Wikipedia, to help bridge between health information systems, and empower consumers with un-derstanding  of  their  health  condition.
