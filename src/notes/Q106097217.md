# Highlights

corpus of some 400 million newspaper articles (from the LexisNexis 2011-2018 corpus, https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/home.page) is processed, breaking the articles into sentences, and indexing these sentences by the words therein, the Wikipedia concepts they refer to13, the entities they mention14,15, and pre-defined lexicon words16.

Finally, the Debate Construction module is a rule-based system that integrates cluster analysis. After removing arguments that are pre-dicted to be redundant, the remaining arguments are clustered30according to their semantic similarity25,31. For each cluster, a theme is identified, which is a Wikipedia concept (such as ‘poverty’) that is statistically enriched in the cluster’s arguments, and is used to intro-duce the respective paragraph. The system then selects the content that will be included in the debate: a salient subset of clusters for the speeches and the arguments per cluster, aiming to keep a diverse set of high-quality arguments20 that reflect the cluster’s theme.
