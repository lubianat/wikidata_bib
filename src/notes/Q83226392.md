# Highlights

This evidence begins with a discovery that transcripts of one or more neuropeptide precursor (NPP) and one or more neuropeptide-selective G-protein-coupled receptor (NP-GPCR) genes are highly abundant in all, or very nearly all, cortical neurons. Individual neurons express diverse subsets of NP signaling genes from palettes encoding 18 NPPs and 29 NP-GPCRs

It is well established that certain neuropeptides, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin (SST), neuropeptide Y (NPY), substance P, and cholecystokinin (CCK), are detectible at high levels in particular subsets of GABAergic cortical neurons (Tremblay et al., 2016). These neuropeptides have come into broad use as markers for particular GABAergic interneuron classes, while the corresponding NPP and NP-GPCR genetics have provided molecular access to these and other broad neuron type classes (Daigle et al., 2018; Maximiliano José et al., 2018)

A narrower but more common definition (Burbach, 2011) requires (1) translation of a neuropeptide precursor protein (NPP) into the lumen of a source neuron’s rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), (2) enzymatic cleavage of the NPP into one or more neuropeptide (NP) products during or after passage through the rER–Golgi complex and packaging into dense-core vesicles, (3) transport and storage of dense-core vesicles within the source neuron, (4) secretion of the NP product upon demand by activity- and calcium-dependent dense-core vesicle exocytosis, and then (5) interstitial diffusion to act upon a target neuron by binding to a ligand-specific receptor

The present study is based on analysis of a resource single-cell RNA-seq dataset acquired at the Allen Institute (Tasic et al., 2018) and available for download at http://celltypes.brain-map.org/rnaseq/.

--> Nice, it is a reuse article.

The RNA-seq data suggest that all, or at least very nearly all, neocortical neurons express at least one NPP gen

The observations presented here suggest the intriguing possibility that the homeostasis, modulation and plasticity of cortical circuitry may involve local neuropeptidergic signaling networks of previously unrecognized abundance and density.
