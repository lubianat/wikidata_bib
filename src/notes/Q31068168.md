# Highlights
CPAD, Curated Protein Aggregation Database

We have developed a Curated Protein Aggregation Database (CPAD), which has collected results from experimental studies performed by scientific community aimed at understanding protein/peptide aggregation. CPAD contains more than 2300 experimentally observed aggregation rates upon mutations in known amyloidogenic proteins

CPAD is freely available at http://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/CPAD/. The potential applications of CPAD have also been discussed.

Systematic collection and curation of accumulating experimental data is necessary to understand the mechanism(s) of protein aggregation and to develop computational algorithms.
