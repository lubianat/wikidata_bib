# Highlights
n the present study, we performed a 2-step approach to simulate Swanson's literature-based discovery methodology in 2 fields of biological research literature that are normally not bibliographically connected: gastric cancer and psychology.

The 2-step discovery process generated a hypothesis about the correlation between anandamide and gastric cancer and provided a possible common molecular network which may mediate the effects. The hypothesis was then investigated experimentally. Anandamide was found to inhibit growth in 4 gastric cancer cell lines, including BGC823, SGC7901, AGS, and N87.

 To further examine the validity of these target genes, several proteins/genes were chosen as examples to verify their relationship to gastric cancer or anandamide through ARROWSMITH SYSTEM.
