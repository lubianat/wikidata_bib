# Highlights

Here, we present a customizable workflow (PS4DR) which not only
integrates high-throughput data such as genome-wide association study (GWAS)
data and gene expression signatures from disease and drug perturbations but also
takes pathway knowledge into consideration to predict drug candidates for
repositioning. 

Therefore, we introduce PS4DR, a multimodal and integrative workflow that uses multiple data modalities (i.e., GWAS and transcriptomics)
together with pathway knowledge
