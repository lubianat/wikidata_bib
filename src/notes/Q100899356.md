# Highlights
SHARE-seq, a highly scalable approach
to measure chromatin accessibility and
gene expression in the same single cell,
links distal regulatory elements to key
lineage-specifying genes and finds that
chromatin accessibility foreshadows
gene expression.


d Lineage-determining genes are marked by domains of
regulatory chromatin (DORCs)

 Intronic RNA is enriched for nascent
RNA, which can be used not only to identify cell types (Habib
et al., 2017) but also to investigate temporal processes in single
cells (La Manno et al., 2018).

Broad Congruence between Chromatin and RNA
Defined Cell Types from SHARE-Seq


SHARE-seq not only resolved cell types from distinct lineages
but could also distinguish between cells of closely related types
(for example, ahigh CD34+ bulge versus alow CD34+ bulge; 

As we move toward a cell atlas, we
anticipate that SHARE-seq will likely play a key role in determining the full diversity of cell types and cell states, the regulators that define them, and the effect of common genetic variants
on molecular processes in specific cell types.
