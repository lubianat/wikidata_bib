# Highlights

Understanding drug regulatory status is a daunting task that requires integrating data from many sources from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), US government publications, and other processes related to drug development. At NCATS, we created Inxight Drugs (https://drugs.ncats.io), a web resource that attempts to address this challenge in a systematic manner. NCATS Inxight Drugs incorporates and unifies a wealth of data, including those supplied by the FDA and from independent public sources.

Yet, this seemingly low rate for the conversion of small molecules into drugs may be deceiving. First, the highest attrition rate is observed in Phase II (8,9). The development of nearly a quarter of all US-approved drugs on the market was facilitated by serendipity, and for anti-cancer drugs this figure reaches a staggering 35% (10).

We have implemented the ISO 11238 standard to produce a definitive, regulatory-grade resource for drug substances, the Global Substance Registration System (G-SRS) (13).

Inxight Drugs builds atop this G-SRS dataset to layer on other information about regulatory status, disease biology, and practical use for drug substances.

Drugs@FDA (https://www.fda.gov/drugsatfda) contains information about products approved by the FDA for human use in the United States,

The related Orange Book (https://www.fda.gov/orangebook) identifies which drug products are therapeutically equivalent

DrugBank (14) is a richly annotated online drug database from OMx Personal Health Analytics Inc. that combines detailed drug data with comprehensive drug target and drug action information.
The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) is a comprehensive collection of clinically approved drugs that was originally made public in 2011 as the NCGC

Inxight incorporates data from multiple independent data sources (vide supra) (Figure 1). To unify these data and to deduce how to merge and collapse information when multiple sources are referring to the same substance, NCATS developed a specialized tool known as Stitcher (https://github.com/ncats/stitcher).

Substances in the Inxight Drugs database are linked by a wide range of semantic relationships. Presence of a salt or a solvate is a critical aspect of drug product ingredients. Thus, accurate representation of chemical structure is essential for certain analyses in drug discovery. Inxight Drugs distinguishes substances based on this criterion and provides a total of 9,413 ‘PARENT → SALT/SOLVATE’ relationships. Active metabolites are sometimes more potent than their parent drugs. In such cases, it is the active metabolite that is responsible for much of the therapeutic action. In this context, the database provides 2,625 ‘PARENT → METABOLITE’ relationships
