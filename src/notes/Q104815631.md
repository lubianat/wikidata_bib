# Highlights
A number of person identifier systems exist, all with their own raison-dâ€™etre, scope and properties. One of the first systems for biodiversity researchers was the Authors of Plant Names database published in 1992 by Brummitt and Powell (6). This assigned standardized abbreviations for all known authors of plant names. Similarly, Harvard University has an index of botanists (https://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_index.html), including a persistent uniform resource locator for an individual botanist.

Finally, Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org) is becoming an increasingly important resource in the life sciences (7). While not specifically a person identifier system, Wikidata contains a wealth of information on people, both living and dead. Wikidata allows for the identification of people not under the scope of other person identifiers, such as those who are not published, but who are notable in other ways, such as being mentioned in the literature or collectors of specimens (8).
