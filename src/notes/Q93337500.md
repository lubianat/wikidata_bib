# Highlights

Based on semantic predications, which consist of a triple structure of subject-predicate-object (SPO), we proposedan automated algorithm to discover knowledge of combination drug therapies using the following rules: 1) two or more semanticpredications (S1-P-O and Si-P-O, i = 2, 3...) can be extracted from one conclusive claim (sentence) in the abstract of a givenpublication, and 2) these predications have an identical predicate (that closely relates to human disease treatment, eg, “treat”) andobject (eg, disease name) but different subjects (eg, drug names)

 There were 15,603 conclusive claimslocally parsed using the search terms “conclusion*” and “conclude*” ready for semantic predications extraction by SemRep, and325 candidate groups of semantic predications about combined medications were automatically discovered within 316 conclusiveclaims. Based on manual analysis, we determined that 255/316 claims (78.46%) were accurately identified as describing combinationtherapies and adopted these to construct the customized knowledge graph.

At the end of 2016, Microsoft announced a  largegraph of concepts harnessed from billions of web pages andsearch logs for short text understanding, called the ConceptGraph. Other frequently mentioned applications are YahooSpark, Facebook’s  entity graph, Wikidata, Freebase, Baidu’sKnowledge Graph, and Sogou’s  Knowledge Cube.

Semantic Knowledge Representation, or SemRep, is a naturallanguage processing tool based on the Unified MedicalLanguage System (UMLS) [20]. This high-quality tool forextracted semantic predication has already been utilized for abroad range of applications such as the construction of abiomedical knowledge graph [21],  identification of apparentcontradictions [22],  labeling for semantic relationships [23],and detection of drug-drug interactions [24] or drug-gene targets[25].

 Inthis study,  we parsed abstracts from PubMed for conclusiveclaims identified by the key words “conclusion*” and“conclude*” (Table 1)  in order to discover knowledge aboutcombination drug therapies

 We investigated the patterns of identified knowledge based onthe mechanism of antineoplastic agents and counted the numberof drug combinations under each pattern (Table 4

he proposed knowledge graph has two major applications. Aninformation retrieval system can utilize the knowledge fromour graph to integrate various external sources of knowledgeand information. Since the subjects and objects of the presentedcombined medications were drawn from the UMLSMetathesaurus by SemRep, it should be straightforward tointegrate our graph with UMLS’s  source vocabularies forinformation retrieval, such as DrugBank, Disease Ontology,NCI thesaurus, SNOMEDCT,  etc. Another major applicationis precision medicine and clinical decision-making support


 The proposed algorithm can be generalized to automaticallydiscover generic combined medications for all human disorders,not just malignant neoplasms.
