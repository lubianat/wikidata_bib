# Highlights

y. CRISPRlnc (http://www.crisprlnc.org or http://crisprlnc.xtbg.ac.cn) is a manually curated database of validated CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNAs for lncRNAs from all species

For example, NONCODE contained more than 350 000 lncRNA genes across 17 species (17). lncRNAdb manually collected and annotated about 300 functional lncRNAs that have been studied to date (18). However, due to the extremely complicated and inconstant mechanisms when compared with protein-coding genes, most of lncRNAs have not been well studied, despite that a host of researches have extensively demonstrated the significance and diversity of lncRNAs in regulatory functions.


As the first database against the validated sgRNAs of lncRNAs, CRISPRlnc will give an efficient assistance when employing CRISPR/Cas9 system as tools for lncRNA genome editing. Moreover, the high-quality integrated information of validated sgRNAs for lncRNAs could be used as a gold standard dataset to guide the design of sgRNAs themselves.


As the first database specifically targeting to the validated sgRNAs of lncRNAs, we sincerely hope to get the support and advice from the academic community to help us improve it. And it is greatly appreciated for submitting data to us.
