# Highlights
Meanwhile, existing databases show remarkable resilience: out of 719 databases featured in the last year's release (4), only 2 were no longer maintained because their authors graduated, retired or changed focus, and one more has shifted to restricted access. In contrast, three databases, ABCdb, EID and KDBI, that were considered dead last year and had been crossed off the list, have now been resurrected. 

After 12 years of database issues and 8 years of the accompanying web supplement, it was interesting to check if they are really having an impact. In other words, how many people really care about them and use them?
Whatever the caveats, the fact that the paper describing the Pfam domain database [http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/, NAR Collection entry no. 210, Ref. (6)] has been cited 375 times in <2 years definitely indicates that this database is widely used by the research community.
