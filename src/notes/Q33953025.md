# Highlights
s. We believe that the classifications of
lncRNAs as indicated above are of fundamental importance
for lncRNA studies, helpful for further investigation of specific
lncRNAs, for formulation of new hypothesis based on different
features of lncRNA and for exploration of the underlying
lncRNA functional mechanisms.

Present studies are mainly focused
on lincRNAs and antisense lncRNAs
(especially lincRNAs), though less is
known about intronic lncRNAs and sense
lncRNAs
It has been found that lncRNAs are predominately localized
in nucleus and chromatin,4

Here, we summarized classification methods of lncRNAs according to their four major characteristics (genomic location and
context, effects on DNA sequences, functional mechanisms and
targeting mechanisms). Based on function annotations presently
available, we explored potential relationships between different classification categories and investigated biological features
of different lncRNAs within each category
