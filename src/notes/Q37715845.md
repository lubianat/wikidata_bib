# Highlights
The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) is a major bioinformatics project that provides structured controlled vocabularies to classify gene product function and location.

Here we describe some of the ways in which GO can change that should be carefully considered by all users of GO as they may have a significant impact on the resulting gene product annotations, and therefore the functional description of the gene product, or the interpretation of analyses performed on GO datasets.

Manual annotations are made by a curator reading full-text primary literature and capturing functional data [4]. Manual annotations provide detailed and specific information and are critical for creating learning sets for automated pipelines.

The ontology request tracker [13] is a publicly available tool for users to request and follow updates to the ontology, and terms affected by a current ontology development project are highlighted in the “GO Discussions” section of the term page in the UniProt-developed GO browser QuickGO [15].

. When substantial changes such as these are made in the UniProt annotation files, an announcement is always provided with the accompanying file release notes, and we encourage users and researchers to read them to ensure that their subsequent analyses benefit [10].

GO terms are generally defined to be taxon neutral, but some are applicable only to certain taxa. In 2010, the GOC started applying taxon restrictions to certain GO terms

In fungi, the MTOC is called the spindle pole body, whilst in mammals it is called the centrosome. In GO we have terms for ‘centrosome organization’ (GO:0051297) and for ‘spindle pole body organization’ (GO:0051300); only fungal gene products should be annotated to the ‘spindle pole body organization’ (GO:0051300) class, therefore the definitions of these terms were clarified so that the meaning is more apparent for curators and users.
