# Highlights

Through participation in the interactive text-mining track of the BioCreative 2012workshop, we developed PubTator, a PubMed-like system that assists with two specific human curation tasks: documenttriage and bioconcept annotation. On the basis of evaluation results from two external user groups, we find that theaccuracy of PubTator-assisted curation is comparable with that of manual curation and that PubTator can significantlyincrease human curatorial speed.
As mentioned earlier, PubTator was formally evaluated be-fore the BioCreative 2012 workshop by two external usergroups: TAIR and NLM.
