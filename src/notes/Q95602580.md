# Highlights

Joint  expression  of ACE2and  the  accessory  proteases  identifies  specific subsets  of  respiratory  epithelial  cells  as  putative  targets  of  viral  infection  in  the  nasal  passages, airways,  and  alveoli.  Cells  that  co-express  ACE2 and  proteases  are  also  identified  in  cells from other  organs,  some  of  which  have  been  associated  with  COVID-19  transmission  or  pathology, including  gut  enterocytes,  corneal  epithelial  cells,  cardiomyocytes,  heart  pericytes,  olfactory sustentacular  cells,  and  renal  epithelial  cells.

 Performing  the  first  meta-analyses  of  scRNA-seq studies, we analyzed 1,176,683 cells from 282 nasal, airway, and lung parenchyma samples from 164 donors spanning fetal, childhood, adult, and elderly age groups, associate increased levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSLin specific cell types with increasing age, male gender, and smoking.

Here,  we  perform  integrated  analysis  of  107  single-cell  and  single-nucleus  RNA-Seq  studies, including  22  studies  of the  lung  and  airways,  and  85 additional  studies  of  other  diverse  tissues, spanning  both  published  and  unpublished  datasets
