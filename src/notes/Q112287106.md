# Highlights

Vaginal lubrication is a crucial physiological response that occurs at the beginning of sexual arousal. However, research on lubrication disorders (LD) is still in its infancy, and the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in LD remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the function of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of vaginal LD.


The expression profiles of LD and normal control (NC) lncRNAs were examined using next-generation sequencing (NGS

The purpose of this study is to screen and study the differential expression of lncRNAs in women who have and do not have vaginal LD in order to further explore its pathophysiological mechanism and to find effective biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
