# Highlights

We developed Slide-seq, a method for transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing.

Using Slide-seq, we localized cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus


Clustering of individual bead profiles from a coronal section of mouse hippocampus (7) yielded assignments reflecting known positions of cell types in the tissue.

To map scRNA-seq cell types onto Slide-seq data, we developed a computational approach called non-negative matrix factorization regression (NMFreg) that reconstructs expression of each Slide-seq bead as a weighted combination of cell type signatures defined by scRNA-seq .

We found that 65.8 ± 1.4% of beads could be matched with a single cell type (7), whereas 32.6 ± 1.2% showed mRNA from two cell types (mean ± SD, N = 7 cerebellar pucks) 


. Vim, Gfap, and Ctsd were chosen because they are known markers of the astrocytic (Vim and Gfap) or microglial (Vim and Ctsd) responses that were found to be highly up-regulated at the injury in the Slide-seq dat

--> markers of cell-type-specific responses; - 2.7. The concept of "cell marker"


The primary cost of Slide-seq is the cost of short-read sequencing, which is ~$200 to $500 for the pucks presented here. As the cost of sequencing drops further, we expect to be able to scale Slide-seq to entire organs or even entire organisms. We anticipate that Slide-seq will be instrumental in positioning molecularly defined cell types in complex tissues and defining molecular pathways involved in neuropathological states.

--> nice!
