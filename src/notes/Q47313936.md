# Highlights

Biological  knowledgebases,  such  as  UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot,  constitute  an  essentialcomponent  of  daily  scientific  research  by  offering  distilled,  summarized  and  computable  know-ledge extracted from the literature by expert curators. While knowledgebases play an increasinglyimportant role in the scientific community, their ability to keep up with the growth of biomedical lit-erature is under scrutiny. Using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as a case study, we address this concern viamultiple literature triage approache

 We show that 90% of the papers in PubMed areout  of  the  scope  of  UniProt,  that  a  maximum  of  2â€“3%  of  the  papers  indexed  in  PubMed  each  yearare relevant for UniProt curation, and that, despite appearances, expert curation in UniProt is scalable.

 Each week, PubTator generates an update for new articles publishedin  a  selected  set  of  relevant  journals  for  protein  research  (Cell,Developmental Cell, Elife, Genes and Development, Molecular Cell,Nature Cell Biology, Nature Genetics, Nature, PLoS Biology, PLoSGenetics, Science, The EMBO Journal, The Plant Cell). All new art-icles are first mined for protein and species information and thenranked based on frequency of protein mentions.

 --> Cool. 

  An independent survey assessing the value ofbiological database services concluded that the benefits to users andtheir funders are equivalent to more than 20 times the direct oper-ational cost of the institute (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/press-releases/value-and-impact-of-the-european-bioinformatics-institute).This is why the common belief that expert curation is highly expen-sive  and  time-consuming  is  incorrect.  From  this  perspective  andfrom our analysis, expert curation should be considered as a majortime-saver for the community for a very limited cost.

  --> Super cool.  3.8 The long tail of biocuration

  In addition, other initiatives could reduce the burden of expertcuration.  Structuring  knowledge  in  scientific  publications  wouldprovide benefits, and initiatives such as SourceData (http://source-data.embo.org)  or  Force11  (Bandrowskiet al.,  2015)  are  verypromisin
