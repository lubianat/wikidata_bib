# Highlights

We recently described the Signaling Pathways Project (SPP)10, an integrated ‘omics knowledgebase designed to assist bench researchers in leveraging publically archived transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq datasets to generate research hypotheses.

We first set out to generate a set of consensomes10 ranking human genes based on statistical measures of the frequency of their significant differential expression in response to infection by MERS, SARS1 and SARS2 CoVs.

. Finally, Table 1 contains links to consensomes in the SPP knowledgebase and NDEx repository – see section “Visualization of the CoV transcriptional regulatory networks in the Signaling Pathways Project knowledgebase and Network Data Exchange repository”


As an initial benchmark for our CoV consensome analysis, we assembled a list of 20 canonical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), whose role in the anti-viral response is best characterized in the context of IAV infection13. As shown in Fig. 1, many ISGs were assigned elevated rankings across the four viral consensomes

We then used the R GeneOverlap package18 to compute the extent and significance of intersections between CoV HCTs and those of the pathway nodes or node families.

Transcription factors Not unexpectedly – and speaking again to validation of the consensomes - the strongest and most significant CoV HCT intersections were observed for HCTs for known transcription factor mediators of the transcriptional response to CoV infectio
