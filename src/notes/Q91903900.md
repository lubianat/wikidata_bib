# Highlights

. In this paper, a knowledge-based system will be proposed for providing different stakeholders with helpful information in the emergency response.

Furthermore, it can lead to a better understanding of the works that should be done if rescuers can compare actual situations (first type) with the theory model. This paper will focus on the knowledge model for the response information, and the knowledge source is the contingency planning system of China.


Obviously, sentence is the basic knowledge element of the system. Its meaning of one sentence is determined by the subject-verb-object of itself, in which subject and object are usually the nouns. Further, these noun phrases are called terms in the ontology learning, which are linguistic realizations of domain-specific concepts (Buitelaar, Cimiano, & Magnini, 2005). Moreover, the relation in the ontology is very much related to verb arguments in the text (Buitelaar et al., 2005). The concept and relation (class and property in the OWL) are the skeleton of the ontology.


A domain ontology is designed to be a canonical, comprehensive representation of the entities in a given science field. Commonly, the knowledge in one domain ontology can be found in a scientific textbook. Gene Ontology and Cell Ontology are classical examples for this kind of ontology.
