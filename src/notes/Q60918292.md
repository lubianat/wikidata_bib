# Highlights
 Over the years, many metadata standards developed by various metadata standards initiatives have arisen; the Genomic Standards Consortiumâ€™s minimal information standards (MIxS), the GSCID/BRC Project and Sample Application Standard. Some tools exist for tracking metadata, but they do not provide event based capabilities to configure, collect, validate, and distribute metadata. To address this gap in the scientific community, an event based data-driven application, OMeta, was created that allows users to quickly configure, collect, validate, distribute, and integrate metadata.

OMeta enables configuration in various presentation types: checkbox, file, drop-box, ontology, and fields can be configured to use the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), a biomedical ontology server.

OMeta was designed with the following goals:

1.Easy to configure and customize for metadata tracking based on the study design

2.Ability to configure and track metadata based on any standards

3.Support event-based metadata tracking in real-time for multi-isolate studies

4.Track the complete audit trail of changes

5.Support changing metadata tracking requirements

6.Data-driven dynamic application to support evolving metadata and study

7.Easy to use
