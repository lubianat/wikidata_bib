====================================

Publication date : 15 of July, 2015  

# Highlights

his paper, we present how
Wikidata is incorporated in the DBpedia eco-system. Enriching DBpedia with structured information from Wikidata provides added value for a number of usage scenarios. We outline those scenarios and describe the structure and conversion process of the DBpediaWikidata (DBW) dataset.

Curation All DBpedia data is extracted from Wikipedia
and Wikipedia authors thus unconciously also curate the DBpedia knowledge base. Wikidata on
the other hand has its own data curation interface
called WikiBase1
, which is based on the MediaWiki framework.
