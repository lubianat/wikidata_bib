# Highlights
We describe the vertebrate Homologous Organs Groups ontology, vHOG, used to compare expression patterns between species.

 vHOG is available from the Bgee download site (http://bgee.unil.ch/), as well as from the OBO Foundry and the NCBO Bioportal websites.

The use of a term for several species in the TAO does not imply homology (Dahdul et al., 2010). A species-specific ontology (e.g. ZFA) is considered a subset of the multispecies ontology (e.g. TAO).

Thus, we present both the first large and high-quality ontology of vertebrate anatomy, and the first ontology strictly limited to homologous structures: vHOG.
