# Highlights

Here, we zoom in on the first 300 RIO articles that have been published and elucidate how they relate to the different stages and variants of the research cycle, how they help address societal challenges and what forms of engagement have evolved around these resources, most of which have a nature and scope that would prevent them from entering the scholarly record via more traditional journals. 

While papers published in RIO have addressed each of the 17 SDGs, some goals remain quite under-represented: five of the goals have 50 or more RIO articles to them, six of the goals have 10 or less (Table 2).

All RIO articles are available in HTML, PDF and JATS XML formats and they include figures - mostly in JPEG or PNG formats - as well as tables in CSV format. Some figures are composite figures. Figures and tables are optional and articles can further be complemented by supplementary materials that may come in any format, with common ones being spreadsheet (CSV, TSV, XLS, XLSX, ODS) and word processing formats (DOC, DOCX, TXT, ODT), as well as presentation formats (PPT, PPTX, ODP) and PDF again. Note that RIO encourages the deposition of data and other such materials in suitable repositories, as well as citation of such deposits.
