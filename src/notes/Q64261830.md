# Highlights

 Here we use the PubMed database to demonstrate the prevalence of words of Greek origin in the language of modern science, and call for scientists to exercise care when coining new terms.

 Our favorite example is the word 'analysis': everyone uses it, but few fully understand it. 'Lysis' means 'breaking up', while 'ana-' means 'from bottom to top' but also 'again/repetitively': the subtle yet ingenious latter meaning of the term implies that if you break up something once, you might not know how it works; however, if you break up something twice, you must have reconstructed it, so you must understand the inner workings of the system.

It is worth noting that no single gene or protein name appears in more than one million records (Seringhaus et al., 2008). When combined into a disjoint query, using the OR operator, these 152 terms retrieve ~27.8M entries, the majority (~97%) of all PubMed records.

From this initial dataset, we used etymological dictionaries to identify 15 terms with Greek origin: analysis, based, clinical, diagnosis, gene, genes, method, period, plasma, protein, proteins, surgery, system, therapy, type.

In the field of genomics, the word epigenomics is an example of a new term being introduced in a thoughtful and meaningful way. However, there are many examples of researchers introducing new variations on the word genomics that are sub-optimal: Jonathan Eisen of the University of California, Davis has coined the term #badomics to describe such words.

(The term pangenome (Tettelin et al., 2005), meaning the full complement of genes in a clade, is also very useful although, strictly speaking, 'pan-' is not a preposition).

# Comments

Interesting. I bet the weight of the authors played a role here, though.
