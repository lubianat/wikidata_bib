# Highlights
Here, we report a
single-cell method for parallel chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and transcriptome
proﬁling. scNMT-seq (single-cell nucleosome, methylation and transcription sequencing)
uses a GpC methyltransferase to label open chromatin followed by bisulﬁte and RNA
sequencing.

Subsequently, we tested locus-speciﬁc associations between
different pairwise combinations of molecular layers (Fig. 3a),
which is distinct from the correlations across genes used for
quality control above and is enabled by parallel single-cell
measurements in multiple cells.
