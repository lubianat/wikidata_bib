Natural killer cell immunotypes related to COVID-19 disease severity

  [@wikidata:Q98622035]  

# Highlights
Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis of peripheral blood NK cells identified distinct NK cell immunotypes  linked to disease severity.

NK cells aretypically divided into cytokine-producing CD56bright NK cells and cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells.
Patients with  COVID-19 disease were sampled for peripheral blood, and analyzed by 28-color flow cytometry.

Preprocessed scRNA-seq data were obtained from a published dataset (24). CD8 T cells were excluded from downstream NK cell analyses based on k-means clustering of CD8 and NK cell markers from the human cell atlas PBMC benchmarking dataset, followed by renormalization of the data.
