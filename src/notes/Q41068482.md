Div-Seq: Single-nucleus RNA-Seq reveals dynamics of rare adult newborn neurons.
===============================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q41068482]  

# Highlights
Here, we develop Div-Seq, which combines scalable single-nucleus RNA-Seq (sNuc-Seq) with pulse labeling of proliferating cells by EdU to profile individual dividing cells

We therefore developed Div-Seq, a method for RNA-seq of individual, recently-divided cells. Div-Seq combines sNuc-Seq with pulse labeling of dividing cells by 5-ethynyl- 2â€™-deoxyuridine (EdU).

Analysis of sNuc-Seq data revealed distinct nuclei clusters (Fig. 1B-D, figs. S4-S5, S6A-C, and table S1) correspond- ing to known cell types and anatomical distinctions in the hippocampus.

The SC newborn neurons expressed the GABAergic markers Gad1 and Gad2, suggesting GABAergic neurogenesis (18) (Fig. 4B).

(B) Major cell types identified from sNuc- Seq data reflected by clusters, shown as 2-D embedding of 1,188 nuclei from adult mouse hippocampus.
