# Highlights
Guided by this, we have designed and developed Bio4j. It aims to offer a platform for the
integration of semantically rich biological data using typed graph model

Conclusion. Bio4j represents a unique resource for the current Bioinformatician, providing at once a solution for
severalkeyproblems: dataintegration; expressive,highperformancedataaccess; andacost-effectivescalablecloud
deployment model.


Incontrast,inthebiologicalbigdatalandscapethereisacleardichotomybetweensotosay“raw”and“structured”,
semantically rich data. Sequencing reads from massively parallel technologies, or unprocessed data from other
high throughput technologies such as microarrays or proteomics experiments would be clear examples of the
first category. For the second we are thinking about, for example, data organized in ontologies such as functional
informationassociatedtoproteins,genesandgenomes,comingfromorganismsclassifiedthemselvesincomplex
taxonomic structures.

We can speak of data integration at different levels; in decreasing order of abstraction
1. model – what
2. access and store – how
3. deployment and distribution – where and when

Bio4j integrates open data coming from different data sources; we include here a short description of each.

- UniProtKB
- Gene Ontology
- UniRef
UniRef contains clusters of UniProtKB sequences
- NCBI taxonomy
- Expasy EnzymeDB

Using Bio4j as a service
A full import of all the integrated data sources is stored in a public S3 bucket, which allows anyone to create an
EC2 instance and use Bio4j in 2 minutes.
