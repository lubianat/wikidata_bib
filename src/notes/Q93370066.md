# Highlights
This study was undertaken to evaluate the use of ontology-based semantic mapping (OS-Mapping) in chemical toxicity assessment. 

. Nineteen chemical-species phenotypic profiles (CSPPs) were constructed by ontologically annotating the toxicity responses reported in more than seven hundred published studies of ten chemicals on six vertebrate species

Phenomics is the systematic study of the phenotypic responses of an organism on a genome-wide scale, which are determined by the complex interactions of its genotypes and environmental conditions. Phenomics adds a new dimension to the discipline of systems biology, which is largely founded on traditional omics. 

The emergence and widespread application of biological ontologies over the last two decades largely coincided with the omics revolution because of the growing necessity to conceptualize, represent, share, and compute this enormous amount of biological knowledge, including phenotypes, across domains and species (Gruber, 1995; Ashburner et al., 2000). An ontology represents a knowledge domain, such as those of omics, anatomies, behavior, disease etc., by a set of predefined web ontology language (OWL) constructs and standard vocabulary (Bard and Rhee, 2004).

An implicit assumption of this approach of ontology-based semantic mapping (OS-Mapping; Washington et al., 2009) is that, when two such subgraphs are similar, their associated chemicals, genes, pathways, or diseases must share convergent biological mechanisms (Gkoutos et al., 2017).
