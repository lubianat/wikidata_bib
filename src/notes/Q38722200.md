# Highlights

Therefore, a deep understanding of the mechanisms and pathways leading to the augmented CD8+ T cell exhaustion and the accumulation of Tregs in cancer will provide better strategies to orchestrate the immune system to eradicate cancers.

LAYN, encoding layilin, was recently reported to be highly expressed in Tregs isolated from lung and colon tumors (De Simone et al., 2016) but it is under-characterized functionally. Based on our data, LAYN exhibited a highly specific expression pattern in both tumor Tregs (C8_CD4-CTLA4) and exhausted TTC cells (C4_CD8-LAYN) (Figure 4A)

However, this swift release of research findings comes with an increased number of
incorrect interpretations (8) which can be problematic when new research articles
are picked up by main-stream media (9). Rapid evaluation of these new research
findings and integration with existing resources requires frictionless access to the
underlying research data upon which the findings are based. This requires
interoperable data and sophisticated integration of these resources. Part of this
integration is reconciliation, which is the process where matching concepts in
Wikidata are sought. Is a particular gene or protein already described in Wikidata?
Using a shared interoperability layer, like Wikidata, different resources can be more
easily linked.
