# Highlights
We propose a deep-learning-based model, Stacked Denoising Autoencoder Multi-Label Learning (SdaMLL), for facilitating gene multi-function discovery and pathway completion. 
Moreover, we found some gene functions, such as Fused in Sarcoma (FUS, which may be part of transcriptional misregulation in cancer) and p27 (which we expect will become a member viral carcinogenesis), that can be used to complete the related pathways. We provide a visual tool (https://www.keaml.cn/gpvisual) to view the new gene functions in cancer pathways.
With more yearly biomedical challenges and newly published databases such as i2b2, TREC Medical/CDS and BioNLP, biomedical text mining techniques have been driven to progress sharply. Hisschman et al. list the following four requirements for a biocurator text mining tool11: 
  1. Easy to use, install and maintain by the intended end user;
  2.  The tool need not be perfect, but it needs to complement the biocuratorâ€™s function; 
  3.  Initial batch processing is necessary; and 
  4. The tool should provide linking of gene expression mentions of biological entities identified in the text with their referents identified in biological data-bases, then link them to the appropriate ontological terms.

In this paper, faced with the task of sifting through the voluminous extant biomedical publications, we pro-pose a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder Multi-Label Learning (SdaMLL) model to explore the effects, if any, gene multi-functions may have on cancer pathways in KEGG. 

In this paper, we have proposed a novel multi-label gene function annotation model based on a deep learn-ing strategy, namely, SdaMLL, for gene multi-function discovery.
