# Highlights

In this practical guide, we provide an
overview of current machine learning methods that have been proposed to expedite evidence synthesis. We also
offer guidance on which of these are ready for use, their strengths and weaknesses, and how a systematic review
team might go about using them in practice.

A further application of machine learning in search is
as a method for producing a semantic search engine, i.e.
one in which the user can search by concept rather than
by keyword. Such a system is akin to searching PubMed
by MeSH terms (index terms from a standardized
vocabulary, which have traditionally been applied
manually by PubMed staff ).
