# Highlights
Currently, BTO contains more than 4600 different anatomical structures, tissues, cell types and cell lines, classified under generic categories corresponding to the rules and formats of the Gene Ontology Consortium and organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 

It is widely used by lab scientists, curators of genomic and biochemical databases and bioinformaticians.

Ontology relationships for ‘muscle fibre’ and its descendants, whereas the term ‘muscle fibre’ is a ‘part_of’ a ‘muscle’ (Symbol: P) and a ‘myoma cell’ ‘develops_from’ a ‘muscle fibre’ (Symbol: d).

The BTO draws upon the comprehensive enzyme-related data repository of the BRENDA enzyme database

To avoid inconsistencies and ambiguities those terms are renamed within the BTO and described in more detail by checking the original literature reference. For example, ‘A6 cell’ is replaced by ‘Xenopus A6 cell’, ‘L6 cell’ by ‘L6 myoblast cell’ and ‘A-14 cell’ by ‘3T3-A14 cell’

.
The BTO is widely used in the scientific community. Queries in web search engines yield ∼10 000 hits for example. 


The BTO is currently designed as a human-readable hierarchical vocabulary of enzyme-containing tissues, which is already widely used in biochemical applications. Making it purpose-independent and to include terms that are not connected to enzymes would allow an even larger and wider application and could increase its value for text mining procedures .
