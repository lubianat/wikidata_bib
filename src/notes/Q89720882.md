# Highlights

A comprehensive murine atlas comprising >32,000 single endothelialcell transcriptomes from 11 mousetissues is reported, and among the subclusters various classical as well as
tissue-specialized endothelial-cell subtypes are defined.


We constructed an atlas of >32,000 single-EC transcriptomes from 11 mouse tissues and identified 78 EC
subclusters, including Aqp7+ intestinal capillaries
and angiogenic ECs in healthy tissues

We therefore scRNAsequenced ECs from 11 adult mouse tissues. To augment
resource value, we provide access to https://www.vibcancer.be/software-tools/ec-atlas to explore the dataset described in
this work.

Next, we selected EC clusters on the basis of the expression of
EC markers (Pecam1, Cdh5) and excluded
contaminating smooth muscle cells
(Acta2), fibroblasts (Col1a1), and red blood
cells (Hba-a1, Hba-a2, Hbb-bs) (Figures S1A and S1B). Cells expressing markers of pericytes (Pdgfrb) or immune cells (Ptprc)
were absent.

. Lymphatic ECs (LECs) are functionally
and anatomically distinct from blood vascular ECs (referred to as
‘‘BECs’’ or ‘‘ECs’’)

Of note, some of these top marker genes were expressed by ECs
from only a single tissue (Pglyrp1, Lcn2, and Tmem100 in brain,
testis, and lung, respectively), whereas other EC markers
(Fabp4, Aqp7, Nkx2-3) were conserved across two or more tissues (Figure 1D)

. Expression of
known brain arterial EC marker genes (Gkn3, Hey1 [Fischer
et al., 2004; Vanlandewijck et al., 2018]) was detected at the arterial end of the pseudotime trajectory, whereas expression of the
known brain vein marker Slc38a5 (Vanlandewijck et al., 2018)
was enriched at the venous end of the trajectory (Figure S5D)

s; (2) tissue-restricted EC
populations (choroid plexus in brain; Madcam1+ veins and
Aqp7+ capillaries in intestines);

Lastly, we assessed the expression pattern of conserved and
tissue-specific EC marker genes in non-endothelial cell types,
taking advantage of the publicly available Tabula Muris datasets
from heart, brain, limb muscle, liver, kidney, and lung (Tabula
Muris Consortium et al., 2018). 


We also
discovered Aqp7+ capillary ECs in intestines. Because AQP7 is
involved in glycerol and fatty-acid transport (Hibuse et al.,
2006), an interesting question is whether Aqp7+ ECs could represent a new alternative mechanism for removing glycerol


Unexpectedly, we also identified the presence of angiogenic
as well as proliferating ECs in otherwise healthy tissues


Nonetheless, this EC Atlas taxonomy in healthy conditions could facilitate the identification of
EC phenotypes during pathological angiogenesis in cancer and
eye disease, targets of current anti-angiogenic therapy.
