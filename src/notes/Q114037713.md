# Highlights

 However, the majority of substrates and pathways regulated by DUBs remain unknown, impeding efforts to prioritize specific enzymes for research and drug development. To assemble a knowledgebase of DUB activities, co-dependent genes, and substrates, we combined targeted experiments using CRISPR libraries and inhibitors with systematic mining of functional genomic databases


 ). Inhibiting DUBs with small molecules has emerged as a particularly promising means of indirectly targeting proteins that are conventionally considered to be ‘undruggable’, typically due to the absence of a binding pocket into which a small molecule might bind; such proteins include transcription factors and scaffolding proteins
