# Highlights

A comprehensive atlas of mouse liver
emergence is described at single-cell
resolution starting at endoderm
progenitor specification, including data
detailing divergence of vascular and
sinusoidal endothelia, hepatoblast
specification, and the emergence of a
distinct, migratory hepatomesenchymal
cell type.

we analyzed 45,334 single-cell transcriptomes from embryonic
day (E)7.5, when endoderm progenitors are specified, to E10.5 liver, when liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell lineages emerge

By E10.5, hepatoblasts, endothelia, and HSCs begin to organize into primitive sinusoidal capillaries (Gordillo et al., 2015). The
cellular interactions that contribute to the establishment of the
sinusoid, including HSC migration, HSEC fenestration, basement membrane formation, and hepatoblast differentiation, are
poorly understood.

3D). Immunostaining identifies emergent mesothelial
populations expressing SOX9 or ISL1, which at E9.5 occupy
the ventral and anterior portions of the tissue, respectively
(Figure 3C). By E10.5, SOX9 is widespread among mesothelial
cells in both caudal and rostral lobes, whereas ISL1 is limited
to the rostral liver mesothelium

A Hepatomesenchymal Hybrid Progenitor Exists within
the Early Liver
The embryonic liver is formed from the posterior ventral foregut
endoderm, which invades the STM in response to migratory

To assess the transcriptional influence of ligands identified
above, we applied NicheNet to predict ligand-target regulatory potential during sinusoidal cell lineage development using
lineage-specific genes as potential pathway targets

Using single-cell transcriptomics, we have charted the emergence of diverse liver parenchymal and non-parenchymal populations from their endodermal and mesodermal ancestors
