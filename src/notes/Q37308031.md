# Highlights

Defining science problems with no-boundary thinking.A well-defined, real-worldscience problem should be based on knowledge of a variety of disciplines, but notfrom a specific currently-defined discipline or several disciplines. We need to definethe science problem with no-boundary thinking, without boundaries of disciplines.

--> Not really clear; it seems to mean basically "interdisciplinary study"

However,it is important to have interdisciplinary thinking, no-boundary thinking, at thebeginning(even before designing biological and biomedical experiments, before preparingsamples, before starting large data collection)

--> Simply asking for good scientific practice

It is the time for us to re-think and clearly define the scientific goal, to work directly towards to the scientific goal!

Bioinformatics is not just a middle-ware, with experimental data collection at oneend and verification of computational analysis results at the other end. Bioinformaticsresearch is not at all just software“black-boxes”between computational scientists andlife scientists

--> This probably would better fit the world as a blog post

Too many people, and not really that good. I wonder what all this people did.
