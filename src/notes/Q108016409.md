# Highlights
Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are proteases 


To assemble a knowledgebase of DUB activities, co-dependent genes, and substrates, we combined targeted experiments using CRISPR libraries and inhibitors with systematic mining of functional genomic databases. Analysis of the Dependency Map, Connectivity Map, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and protein-protein interaction databases yielded specific hypotheses about DUB function, a subset of which were confirmed in follow-on experiments.

The data in this paper, which are browsable online via the DUB Portal.

In this paper, we take a combined and relatively unbiased computational and experimental
approach to investigating the functions of DUBs, with an emphasis on cancer cell lines in which DUB
inhibitors have been most extensively studied


Analysis of DUB essentiality using publicly available datasets
Differences in the expression of DUBs in normal tissues and malignant tumors has been
described previously (Luise et al., 2011), but the direct impact of DUB deletion on specific types of cells
has not yet been explored systematically. We therefore investigated the essentiality of DUBs for cancer
cells and embryonic development by leveraging three datasets: the DepMap, the International Mouse
Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) dataset, and the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) mouse phenotype
dataset
