# Highlights
Interoperability between datasets, either the
datasets need to use the same (set of) ontologies, or the ontologies themselves need to be aligned and mapped. The former requires implementation of extensive (social) processes to achieve consensus, while the latter
requires relatively advanced semantic engineering. 

Here, we propose that Wikidata can be used as an intuitive resource for resolvable IRIs both for teaching and studying semantic data
modeling.

To disseminate expertise of FAIRification, so-called Bring Your Own Data
(BYOD) workshops have been conducted for the last five years, where FAIR
and domain experts work together to FAIRify heterogeneous data [2].

What Wikipedia is to text, Wikidata is to data: anyone, both humans and machines, can contribute to Wikidata as long as its primary source of the contribution is available under a public license.
