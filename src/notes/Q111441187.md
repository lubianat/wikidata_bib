# Highlights

Here we develop vessel isolation and nuclei
extraction for sequencing (VINE-seq) to profile the major vascular and perivascular
cell types of the human brain through 143,793 single-nucleus transcriptomes from
25 hippocampus and cortex samples of 9 individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and
8 individuals with no cognitive impairment.

Protein Atlas 25 (http://www.proteinatlas.org).
Visualization in uni-
form manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) space separated
nuclei into 15 major cell types (Fig. 1b), including all known vascular and
perivascular cell types: endothelial cells (arterial, capillary and venous),
SMCs, pericytes, astrocytes, macrophages, T cells, and both perivascu-
lar and meningeal fibroblasts.

Vascular cell-type
markers were validated in situ (Fig. 1c). Data can be browsed at https://
twc-stanford.shinyapps.io/human_bbb.

Closer comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between fibroblast populations revealed a polarization of solute influx and efflux pumps: meningeal fibroblasts specifically expressed SLC influx solute transporters, whereas perivascular fibroblasts exclusively expressed ABC efflux pumps (Fig. 4d).

 Overall, mural cells exhibited the strongest changes, and other cell types exhibited a signature of gene repression: 61–78% of DEGs were downregulated (Fig. 5c). DEGs were robustly detected across different levels of expression (Supplementary Table 6).
