# Highlights

. Here, we developed the BioM2MetDisease database, which currently documents 2681 entries of relationships between 1147 biomolecules (miRNAs, metabolites and small molecules/drugs) and 78 metabolic diseases across 14 species.
To fill this gap, we have developed the BioM2MetDisease database which collects experimental supported associations between biomolecules (miRNAs, metabolites, small molecules/drugs) and metabolic diseases. All associations in BioM2MetDisease were manually curated from literatures.
