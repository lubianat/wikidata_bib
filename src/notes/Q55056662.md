# Highlights
We have discovered errors in the
EMBL nucleotide sequence databank in
the course of training of artificial neural
networks to recognize pre-messenger
RNA splicing signals

The problem of errors in the sequences
incorporated in databanks could be amplified in the future

We therefore
propose that computerized proof reading
should be incorporated in the databanks,
so as to take advantage of the ability of
neural networks to reveal non-linearit
ies
in a dataset, as we have demonstrated.
