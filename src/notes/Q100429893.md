SC2disease: a manually curated database of single-cell transcriptome for human diseases

# Highlights

SC2disease (http://easybioai.com/sc2disease/)isa manually curated database that aims to provide a comprehensive and accurate resource of gene expression profiles in various cell types for different diseases.


--> Website a bit confusing to use, though.

we reanalyzed gene expression matrix by unified pipeline to improve the comparabil- ity between different studies. For each disease, we also compare cell-type-specific genes with the cor- responding genes of lead single nucleotide polymor- phisms (SNPs)

Figure 2. SC2diseases collects 25 human diseases-related cell-type-specific genes obtained by scRNA-seq. All the cells were extracted from 29 tissues and classified into 341 cell types.

Cell-type-specific genes and their expression in human dis- eases were manually extracted from publications.

Figure 3 shows a histogram ofthe number ofcell types for
each disease. Due to the different experimental tissues used in each study, the number of cell types in different diseases vary. However, some studies did not cluster cells, so some diseases only have one cell type.

--> Weird phrasing and clear mix of cell type and cell cluster.

# Comments

Readability of text and figures could be improved. I am a bit shocked it got into NAR like that.
