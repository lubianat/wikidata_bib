# Highlights
The US National Cancer Institute (NCI) is launching a project to identify, catalogue and enter into the public database its own set of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, or ‘snips’) — single-base variations in human DNA that are useful genetic markers.

The project, which also involves the National Center for Biotechnology Information, will receive $1.6 million this year, and planners have already chosen 300 of the 1,000 genes to be studied.


But NHGRI's director, Francis Collins, told him that he had “a little trouble with the notion that you're going to automatically overlook polymorphisms that are present in other ethnic groups than Europeans”.

Collins said he feared that “going back later” to find SNPs in ethnically diverse groups will be “less attractive” to researchers than if SNPs were first identified in an ethnically mixed set of samples.
