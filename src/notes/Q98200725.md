# Highlights

We propose a novel target prioritization approach, GuiltyTargets, which relies on attributed network representation
learning of a genome-wide protein-protein interaction network annotated with disease-specific differential gene expression and uses
positive-unlabeled (PU) machine learning for candidate ranking.

GuiltyTargets first
embeds a genome-wide protein-protein interaction (PPI) net-
work annotated with differential gene expression information
in a Euclidean space using Gat2Vec, an attributed network
representation learning method [27]. It then learns to rank
candidate targets, leveraging network representation learning
techniques to implicitly learn relevant features to represent a
protein-protein interaction network together with mapped data
rather than manually engineering various topological network
attributes in a time consuming process that might still miss
relevant information.
