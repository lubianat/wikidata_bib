# Highlights
We constructed CellTalkDB (http://tcm.zju.edu.cn/celltalkdb), a manually curated comprehensive database of LR interaction pairs in humans and mice comprising 3398 human LR pairs and 2033 mouse LR pairs, through text mining and manual verification of known protein–protein interactions using the STRING database, with literature-supported evidence for each pair.

Human and mouse PPIs, i.e. protein network data, were obtained
from the STRING database (version: 11.0, https://string-db.org/)
containing 11 759 454 and 11 944 806 PPIs in humans and
mice, respectively

• CellTalkDB largely expands the prior knowledge of
ligand–receptor interactions, which will further the
investigation of cell–cell communications based on
single-cell transcriptomics.
• CellTalkDB provides a user-friendly and informative
website for browsing, searching and downloading
ligand-receptor pairs.
