# Highlights
The Chinese National Infrastructure of Cell Line stores and distributes cell lines for biomedical research in China. This study aims to represent and integrate the information of NICR cell lines into the community-based Cell Line Ontology (CLO).


In summary, all identified cell lines from NICR are represented by the semantics framework of CLO and incorporated into CLO as a most recent update

Cell line depositories, such as American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (http://www.atcc.org/), Coriell Cell Repositories (https://catalog.coriell.org/) and the Japanese Collection of Research Resources Bank (JCRB) (http://cellbank.nibiohn.go.jp), provide well-characterized and authenticated cells for usage in biomedical research [2].

The Chinese National Infrastructure of Cell Line Resource (NICR) (http://www.cellresource.cn/) is a non-profit, national cell line repository,
