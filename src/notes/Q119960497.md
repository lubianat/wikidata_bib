Handling Wikidata Qualifiers in Reasoning
=========================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q119960497]  
  

# Highlights
(Province of North Carolina, part of, Southern Colonies )
[start time : 10 May 1775, end time : 4 July 1776]
(3)
and
(Southern Colonies, part of, British Empire )
[start time : 9 June 1732, end time : 4 July 1776]
(4)
one can infer
(Province of North Carolina, part of, British Empire )
[start time : 10 May 1775, end time : 4 July 1776]
(5)
In this case, the validity time of the inferred statements, defined by start time and end time, is
the intersection of statement (3) and (4) validity times.


These qualifiers vary from one statement to another. A study of the most prominent Wikidata
qualifiers10revealed that a large part of them serve to:
1. Specify some temporal or spatial or other restriction on the validity context of the statement
(valid in, start time, end time, etc.) or
2. Annotate the statement with additional information that qualifies, among others, the
statementâ€™s cause or provenance, the position of the subject or object in a sequence, etc.

3. A many-sorted logic for Wikidata
In this section, we propose to use a many-sorted logic (MSL) approach to formalize the semantics
of Wikidata knowledge graph. To this end we will map every Wikidata statement to an MSL
atom and we will add axioms, in the form of an algebraic specification, to specify the behavior
of the qualifiers in reasoning. Let us start by defining a MSL representation technique for
multi-qualified knowledge graphs
