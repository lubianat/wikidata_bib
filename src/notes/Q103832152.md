# Highlights
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are key enzymes in the mRNA translation machinery, yet they possess numerous non-canonical functions developed during the evolution of complex organisms. The aaRSs and aaRS-interacting multi-functional proteins (AIMPs) are continually being implicated in tumorigenesis, but these connections are often limited in scope, focusing on specific aaRSs in distinct cancer subtypes

. We examined aaRS expression data produced by the TCGA project and combined this with patient survival data to recognize trends in aaRSsâ€™ impact on cancer both molecularly and prognostically.

In summary, primarily using the analysis tools cBioPortal, GEPIA2, and the public database generated by the TCGA project, we provide a comprehensive and unbiased study of aaRSs in cancer.
