# Highlights
Here, we used scRNA-seq of over 50,000 resting and activated
T cells from lung (LG), lymph nodes (LN), bone marrow (BM)
and blood, along with integrated computational analysis to deÔ¨Åne
cellular states of homeostasis and activation of human blood and
tissue-derived T cells.

Tissue site was also a source of variability; T cells
from BM and LN co-localized while LG T cells were more distinct
(Fig. 1b), consistent with a greater proportion of CD8 + T cells
and TRM phenotype cells in LG relative to the two lymphoid sites
(Supplementary Fig. 2 and previous studies 10,13,3
