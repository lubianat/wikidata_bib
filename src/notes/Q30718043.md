# Highlights

For this reason, we attempted to facilitate discovery of novel treatments for DR by complementing the interpretation of omic results using the vast body of information existing in the published literature with the literature-based discovery (LBD) approaches.

 Using the SemBT LBD framework, we have determined which therapies could regulate perturbed pathways or that could stabilize the gene expression alterations in DR. We show that by using this approach, we not only could reidentify drugs currently in use or in clinical trials, but also could indicate novel treatment directions for ameliorating neovascularization processes in DR.

 Several tools allowing LBD-based therapeutics discovery are now available, including two algorithms developed by our group—BITOLA [15–17] and SemBT [18, 19].

 For integration of omic data and LBD, we have developed discovery patterns, which are query combinations whose results represent a novel hypothesis—not evident in the literature or in the microarray results alone. 

 For example, to investigate genes that are upregulated in the microarray, we searched for concepts (genes, drugs, etc.) that are reported in the literature as inhibiting the upregulated genes. We call this discovery pattern “inhibit the upregulated.” Similarly, we investigated downregulated genes with the “stimulate the downregulated” pattern.


In conclusion, the work presented incorporates a novel strategy towards identification of treatments for human disease based on integration of data from omic technologies with LBD and provides novel therapeutic directions for treating neovascularization processes occurring in DR.
