# Highlights

 In this review, we establish a complete overview of these resources, and the numbers are overwhelming: over 120 different NP databases and collections were published and re-used since 2000. 98 of them are still somehow accessible and only 50 are open access.

 With this review, we also compiled the open-access natural compounds in one single dataset a COlleCtion of Open NatUral producTs (COCONUT), which is available on Zenodo and contains structures and sparse annotations for over 400,000 non-redundant NPs, which makes it the biggest open collection of NPs available to this date.

 However, as for most of the definitions in life sciences, the line between primary and secondary metabolites is very thin and depends on the potential application of the molecule to categorise This categorisation justifies the necessity of dedicated NP databases or a proper annotation in generalistic databases of molecules.

 For instance, between 1981 and 2014 over 50% of newly developed drugs were developed from NPs [1].
