# Highlights

. The I4OC estimated that 59% of all Crossref citations had already become open by December 2020 (https://i4oc.org/#about; website checked on January 14, 2021). This surge in availability has enabled the large-scale use of citation information for the analysis of biomedical articles. Leveraging such data, for example, Rodriguez-Esteban [4] pointed out that terms with ambiguous meaning are typically not ambiguous within the network of articles directly connected by citations.

--> Nice.
