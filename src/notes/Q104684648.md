# Highlights

Intravascular cell labeling,cell transplantation, and fate-mapping studies established that classical CD14+blood monocytes derivedfrom HSPCs migrated into lung tissue and gave rise to human interstitial and alveolar macrophages. Incontrast, non-classical CD16+blood monocytes preferentially generated macrophages resident in the lungvasculature (pulmonary intravascular macrophages). Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing defined intermedi-ate differentiation stages in human lung macrophage development from blood monocytes. This study iden-tifies distinct developmental pathways from circulating monocytes to lung macrophages and reveals howcellular origin contributes to human macrophage identity, diversity, and localizationin vivo.

Alveolar macrophagescatabolize lung surfactant, phagocytose-inhaled material, andorchestrate immune responses against airborne microbes.

itions, are continuously exposedto respiratory pathogens. Overall, these studies highlight theimportance of monocyte-derived lung macrophages in humans,yet their developmental paths and cellular precursors remainundefined.Circulating monocytes can enter tissues and differentiate intotissue-resident macrophages (Guilliams et al., 2018). In humans,the two main subsets of blood monocytes are classicalCD14+CD16–monocytes  and  non-classical  CD14loCD16+monocytes that patrol blood vessels (Cros et al., 2010;Ziegler-Heitbrock, 2015). According to the current model, classicalmonocytes either extravasate into tissues or differentiate intopatrolling CD14loCD16+monocytes via CD14+CD16+intermedi-ate monocytes (Patel et al., 2017a;Tak et al., 2017). 

nvestigating human macrophagesin vivorepresents aconsiderable challenge. Therefore, we developed a humanizedmouse model, named ‘‘MISTRG’’ (Rongvaux et al., 2014), ex-pressing factors that are critical for human hematopoiesisthrough genetic targeting, thereby overcoming the lack ofcross-reactivity between mouse factors and human receptors
