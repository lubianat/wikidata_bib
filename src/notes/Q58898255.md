# Highlights
academic search engines and bibliographic databases (ASEBDs) 

By our estimation Google Scholar, with 389 million records, is currently the most comprehensive
academic search engine.

Google Scholar’s aim is to index
the entire universe of scholarly information, estimating its size has attracted numerous academic works. Knowing Google Scholar’s size and growth might be indicative of the size
and growth of scholarly data as a whole (Orduña-Malea et al. 2015; Halevi et al. 2017):
“[p]erhaps even Google Scholar does not know this “number”… a number that approximately represents the online scientifc heritage circulating at present

Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that accessible records do not mean accessible unique records. Indeed, search systems often include a signifcant portion of duplicates
and indexing, or other cataloguing errors seemingly boost the total size of the system while
not providing any new information to the user
