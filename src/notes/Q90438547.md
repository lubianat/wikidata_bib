# Highlights

To facilitate interpretation of microRNA studies in these tissues, we used previously generated data to develop a
publicly accessible and user-friendly database to enable exploration of cell type enriched microRNA
expression

Similar to transcription factors, the cell type specifc miRNA code can tune which genes are actively expressed in a given cell type.

In fact, several groups have demonstrated that ectopic miRNA expression is sufcient to direct and reprogram cell
identity, including induced pluripotent stem cells and neurons

He et al. developed a tool for genetic expression of a tagged
Argonaute-2 in mice, characterizing miRNA expression in several neuronal cell types in cortex and cerebellum

we pooled data across studies utilizing this Cre-dependent miRNA afnity
purifcation technique9
 to identify cell type specifc miRNAs across major cell types within the mouse CNS

 In this report, we describe the creation of a website (miRNA.wustl.edu)

 --> Website does DEGs, but not explicit "markers"

# Comments

Not very useful database for me in the end, but I appreciate the effort.
