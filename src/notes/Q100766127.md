# Highlights

Using a novel technique, a massive database
of qualitatively described citations, and machine learning algorithms, we analyzed 1,923,575
Wikipedia articles which cited a total of 824,298 scientific articles in our database, and found
that most scientific articles cited by Wikipedia articles are uncited or untested by subsequent
studies, and the remainder show a wide variability in contradicting or supporting evidence.
Additionally, we analyzed 51,804,643 scientific articles from journals indexed in the Web of
Science and found that similarly most were uncited or untested by subsequent studies, while
the remainder show a wide variability in contradicting or supporting evidence

--> Funny way of writing it.

With over
18 billion visits per month [1], currently ranking it as the 14th most visited website in the
world across all languages as of August, 2020 [2], it has become the go-to source of
information for nearly all aspects of life

--> 1.2.4. Wikidata and Knowledge Graphs Wikipedia is so powerful


 Other research shows that the
types of papers cited by Wikipedia articles are similar to those cited by scholarly publications
(albeit with a slight preference for high-impact articles) [6], and that Wikipedia articles appear
to be biased in favor of citing articles that are available through open access [7]. 

Smart citations provide the context for each citation
and a classification describing whether it provides supporting or contradicting evidence for
the cited claim. Classifications are performed by a deep learning model that has been
trained on 43,665 expert-labeled citation statements with precision scores of 0.800, 0.8519,
and 0.9615 for supporting, contradicting, and mentioning classifications

. Amongscientific articles referenced by Wikipedia articles, the average number of citations was
130.52 (SD=476.93)

--> Lol, clearly not a normal distribution


In conclusion, Wikipedia references scientific articles that are more than twice as likely to be
supported than the scientific literature in general; 28.5% of articles referenced in Wikipedia
have a supporting citation vs. 11.7% of articles in Web of Science, although most are
untested with a minority being contradicted. When Wikipedia articles cite scientific papers
that have been subsequently retracted, 50% of the retracted papers could not be identified
as retracted within the Wikipedia article itself
