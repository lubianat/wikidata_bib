# Highlights
identifying the correct content descriptors
is almost impossible for inexperienced users
of online term repositories. For example,
Medical Subject Headings (www.nlm.nih.
gov/mesh), the International Classification of
Diseases (www.who.int/classifications/icd/
en) and Gene Ontology (www.geneontology.
org) are high-volume — tens of thousands of
terms — and structurally complicated
terminological systems, each with different
design rationales, naming conventions and
principles of structural organization.

--> And this in 2007!

Will scientists find the time to
dive so deeply into this alien terminological
territory, and be capable of finding exactly
what they are looking for?

The size of the
terminology gap is likely to be even more
pronounced if authors were required to
encode relational descriptions, for example
indicating a binding relation between two
specific proteins, P1 and P2, by Bind(P1, P2),
because such a vocabulary has not yet been
determined.

. If authors’ structured
entries were subject to peer review together
with the submitted article, this would be
more work for the reviewers as well as the
authors — neither of them likely to have been
trained as terminologists.

As an alternative, we suggest automated
procedures for knowledge capture in which
neither the authors nor the reviewers are in
the loop.

--> Not really possible with the current state of biomedical theory
