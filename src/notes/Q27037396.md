# Highlights
we address the quality of taxonomic hierarchies in Wikidata. We focus on taxonomic hierarchies with entities at different classification levels (particular individuals, types of individuals, types of types of individuals, etc.).

In several knowledge domains, classes themselves may be subject to categorization, resulting in classes of classes (or metaclasses)

Given the inherent complexity of dealing with multiple
classification levels simultaneously, it is not surprising that the quality of multi-level taxonomic structures in Wikidata is not consistently high.

We argue that the quality of taxonomic structures is key to properly capturing knowledge in Wikidata


In a recent development, some of us have proposed in [12] an
axiomatic theory for multi-level modeling called MLT. The
theory is founded on the notion of (ontological) instantiation,
which is applied regularly across levels (“orders”).
