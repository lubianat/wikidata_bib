# Highlights

NKT  cells  express  an  invariant  T  cellreceptor (TCR)  chain (V14-J281in mice and V24-JQ in humans)

andrecognize  glycolipid  antigens,  such  asthe  endogenous  isoglobotrihexosyl-ceramide  (iGb3)  (2)  and  the  syntheticglycolipid, -galactosylceramide (-Gal-Cer),  in  association  with  the  MHCclass  Iâ€“like  molecule  CD1

In addition  to  type  I  NKT  cells,  apopulation   of   CD1d-reactive   NKTcells  that  express  diverse  non-V14TCRs, referred to as type II NKT cells,has  been  described. 


Thus,  typeI and type II NKT cells appear to havedistinct   functional   capabilities,   butthese  functional  differences  have  notbeen well characterized.


Organ-specific functional maturation of NKT cell subsets?

How  do  distinct  NKT  cell  subsets,  orNKT  cells  in  different  organs,  acquiredifferent  functional  capabilities?  Onepossibility  is  that  functionally  distinctNKT cell subsets diverge after their de-velopment in the thymus.

bothCD4  and  DN  NKT  cells  are  derivedfrom heat stable antigen (HSA)high dou-ble  positive  thymocytes  (15).

It  also  seems  likely  that  the  uniqueanatomical  features  of  the  liver  couldendow hepatic NKT cells with special-ized functions. APCs in the liver mightcapture and present exogenous glycolip-ids  from  the  alimentary  tract,  such  asglycosphingolipids  derived  from  Gram-negative bacteria including Ehrlichia andSphingomonas
