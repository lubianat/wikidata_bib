# Highlights

The Open-Source Chemistry Analysis Routines (OSCAR) software, a toolkit for the recognition of named entities and
data in chemistry publications, has been developed since 2002. Recent work has resulted in the separation of the
core OSCAR functionality and its release as the OSCAR4 library. This library features a modular API (based on
reduction of surface coupling) that permits client programmers to easily incorporate it into external applications.
OSCAR4 offers a domain-independent architecture upon which chemistry specific text-mining tools can be built,
and its development and usage are discussed

, we
estimate that about 10 million chemical syntheses per
year are published in the public literature (articles,
patents, theses) and the conventional method is a natural language narrative (most commonly in English)

The OSCAR-ChEBI project. This was a competitive funding resource for eScience products and we
worked with the European Bioinformatics Institute
(EBI) to develop OSCAR as an appropriate tool for
the extraction and verification of chemistry in the
ChEBI ontology

a list of “nonchemical” words is determined by removing those
words that occur in the chemical word list from a
standard English dictionary. These lists are used to
build an n-gram model which is used by a naïve Bayesian classifier to determine whether novel tokens are
“chemical” or “non-chemical”. Multi-token named entities, e.g. “ethyl acetate”, that occur within the input
text are then identified by regex-style matching of chemical tokens to a set of pre-specified pattern definitions such as “*yl *ate
