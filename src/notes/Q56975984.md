# Highlights

A first step in this process is to generate mappings between the
elements of these different sources. There are a number of well-
known techniques for generating mappings (also known as ontology
alignemnt), both manual and automatic[7]. S

Here we describe an ontology construction technique that takes
two or more ontologies linked by hypothetical axioms, and
estimates the most likely unified logical ontology. Hypothetical
axioms can themselves be derived from semantically loose
mappings. The method combines deductive reasoning and
probabilistic inference and is called Bayesian OWL Ontology
Merging (BOOM).
