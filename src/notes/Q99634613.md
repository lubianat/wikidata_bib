# Highlights

Here we use single-nucleus RNA sequencing to show that progranulin deficiency promotes microglial transition from a homeostatic to a disease-specific state that causes endolysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration in mice. These defects persist even when Grn−/− microglia are cultured ex vivo

--> is "Grn−/− microglia " a cell type? I'd say yes. The taxon in Grn-/- mice.  https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105532260

conditioned media from Grn−/− microglia are sufficient to promote TDP-43 granule formation, nuclear pore defects and cell death in excitatory neurons via the complement activation pathway. Consistent with these results, deletion of the genes encoding C1qa and C3 mitigates microglial toxicity and rescues TDP-43 proteinopathy and neurodegeneration.

--> Hard to formally represent, but not impossible.

To unravel the contributions of glial and neuronal pathologies to
neurodegeneration in the thalamus of Grn−/− mice, we performed
single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq)10,11 in microdissected
thalami from Grn+/+ and Grn−/− mice aged 2, 4, 7, 12 and 19 months. We
isolated nuclei from 38 thalamus samples, including 3–4 biological
replicates per age per genotype

--> good sampling

burden analysis for glia and neuronal clusters in the thalamus of Grn−/− mice
compared to the thalamus of Grn+/+ mice at 19 months. The box plots show
the median, and the 25th to 75th percentiles, and the whiskers represent the
maximum and minimum

--> Super cool. Simple and informative.

Grn−/− microglia transition to disease state

To determine how PGRN deficiency alters the transcriptomes in
thalamic microglia (Th-MG), we performed hierarchical clustering of snRNA-seq profiles averaged by animal. While Grn+/+ Th-MG
exhibited very limited changes from 2 to 19 months, Grn−/− Th-MG
showed transcriptomic changes that began at 7 months and became
more drastic at 12 and 19 months
--> Th-MG https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q105532433


100 DEGs in Grn−/−
P3-MG, 14 of which were consistently upregulated or downregulated
in 19-month-old Grn−/− Th-MG (P = 1.35 × 10−17; Extended Data Fig. 5e–g).

--> "19-month-old Grn−/− Th-MG "; is that a cell type? Once more, I'd say yes.

Indeed, TDP-43 granules induced by Grn−/− microglia are morphologically different
from stress granules20–22. Whether they are related to those induced by
axotomy, traumatic brain injury or muscle regeneration26–28 remains
to be investigated.
