# Highlights
Additionally, we develop an open-source cell type
classiﬁer, SeqSeek, to facilitate the standardization of cell type identiﬁcation. This work
provides an integrated view of spinal cell types, their gene expression signatures, and their
molecular organization.

ur ﬁrst major goal was to create a harmonized atlas of the
major spinal cord cell types that are shared across these studies
and we considered whether it would be possible to register
different studies to each other and thereby identify a common set
of cell types that would simply require the resolution of
differences in nomenclature.


We used a dendrogram analysis of
the distance between the clusters within the 50-dimensional
principal component space. This revealed that the primary dis-
tinctions within spinal interneurons/projection neurons (non-
motoneurons) were based on spatial location in the dorsal horn
or mid/ventral regions of the spinal cord.


SeqSeek: a community resource for analyzing and classifying
spinal cord cell types. Finally, we have developed an online
resource for spinal cord single-cell data, SeqSeek (available at
seqseek.ninds.nih.gov).
