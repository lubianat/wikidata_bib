# Highlights
Using single-cell RNA sequencing analyzing 28,726 cells, we identified neural stem cell and neural progenitor cell pools and neurons. Additionally, we detailed the expression of 140 olfactory receptors. These data from the olfactory neuroepithelium niche provide evidence that neuron production may continue for decades in humans.

To investigate the presence of true neurogenic progenitors and nascent neurons, we obtained fresh tissue samples from adult patients undergoing endoscopic nasal surgery involving resection of the anterior skull base or wide dissection for neurosurgical access (n = 7 individuals). These cases provided access to normal olfactory cleft or turbinate tissue, which was uninvolved with any pathology but required removal (Supplementary Table 1). Samples were processed for scRNA-seq (four cases) and/or IHC.

While our samples comprised olfactory and respiratory mucosa, olfactory neuroepithelial cells clustered distinctly from other cell types (Fig. 1a–c) and aggregated together in batch-corrected samples pooled from separate individuals (Fig. 1b,c). 

Cell type assignments for each cluster were generated using Gene Ontology and pathway analysis, using multiple known murine marker genes for horizontal basal cells (HBCs), globose basal cells (GBCs), immature and mature olfactory neurons, as well as Bowman’s glands, olfactory neuroepithelium sustentacular cells5, endothelial/perivascular cells12 or immune cells (Fig. 1b–d and Extended Data Fig. 1).

Cell-type-specific marker validation in human versus mouse olfactory mucosal sections. TUJ1 labels the somata of immature OSNs, which are more abundant in our adult human samples (n = 3, two-sided Welch’s t-test, P = 0.015).


However, consistent with previous findings reporting that immature neurons are more likely to transiently express multiple olfactory receptors, since singular olfactory receptor choice is not yet stabilized18, we found that coexpression of >3 olfactory receptors was more often identifiable in immature OSNs compared to mature OSNs (P = 0.01). 

The ‘one-neuron/one-receptor’ rule19,20 appeared to generally hold true, since most mature OSNs express only one olfactory receptor (75%), with 14% expressing 2 and <1% expressing 3 (Fig. 3b). 

While we did not find other vomeronasal-1 receptors or trace amino acid receptors, we cannot exclude their expression by cells not captured in our biopsies.

 
Expression levels of all olfactory receptors (n = 545 total receptors) in immature (GNG8+) and mature (GNG13+) OSNs.
In addition, we define a large set of olfactory receptors that appear to be expressed in the human olfactory neuroepithelium and provide support for singular olfactory receptor expression in mature olfactory neurons. Together, these results provide detailed insights into olfactory neurogenesis in the adult human.

 The following cell types were annotated (selected markers are listed): CD8+ T Cells (CD3D, CD3E, CD8A); CD4+ T Cells (CD3D, CD3E, CD4, IL7R); natural killer cells (FGFBP2, FCGR3A, CX3CR1); B cells (CD19, CD79A, MS4A4A); plasma cells (MZB1, SDC1, CD79A); monocytes (CD14, S100A12, CLEC10A); macrophages (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC); dendritic cells (CD1C and lack of expression of C1QA, C1QB and C1QC); mast cells (TPSB2, TPSAB1); fibroblasts/stromal cells (LUM, DCN, CLEC11A); respiratory ciliated cells (FOXJ1, CFAP126, STOML3); respiratory HBCs (KRT5, TP63, SOX2); respiratory gland progenitor cells (SOX9, SCGB1A1); respiratory secretory cells (MUC5, CYP4B1, TFF3); vascular smooth muscle cells (TAGLN, MYH11); pericytes (SOX17, ENG); Bowman’s glands (SOX9, SOX10, MUC5, GPX3); olfactory HBCs (TP63, KRT5, CXCL14, SOX2, MEG3); olfactory ensheathing glia (S100B, PLP1, PMP2, MPZ, ALX3); olfactory microvillar cells (ASCL3, CFTR, HEPACAM2, FOXL1); immature neurons (GNG8, OLIG2, EBF2, LHX2, CBX8); mature neurons (GNG13, EBF2, CBX8, RTP1); GBCs (HES6, ASCL1, CXCR4, SOX2, EZH2, NEUROD1, NEUROG1); and sustentacular cells (CYP2A13, CYP2J2, GPX6, ERMN, SOX2).
