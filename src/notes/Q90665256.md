Construction of a human cell landscape at single-cell level
===========================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q90665256]  

# Highlights

Master TFs work in discrete modules to specify major human cell types such as neuron, erythroid cell and cainar cell. 

Mapping of human cell types by  scHCL. Match to reference transcriptomes by correlation. 

Integrated data to the Mouse Cell Atlas.

We propose a landscape model that is conserved in mammal: stem cells are transcriptionally "indistinct" and "stochastic" and differentiated cells are transcriptionally "distinct" and "stable"; the wiring of the regulons in the genome pre determines the terminal steady cellular states.
