# Highlights

 These types of images can be challenging to segment automatically for several reasons, including the relevance of biomedical context, dependence on the specific set of probes used, prohibitive cost of generating labeled training data, as well as the complexity and dense packing of anatomical structures in the image. The use of an application ontology helps surmount these challenges by combining image data with its metadata to provide a meaningful biological context, modeled after how a human expert would make use of contextual information to identify histological structures, that constrains and simplifies the process of segmentation and object identification.

We demonstrate the results of ontology-guided segmentation and object identification in mouse developmental lung images from the Bioinformatics REsource ATlas for the Healthy lung database of the Molecular Atlas of Lung Development (LungMAP1) program

This process is automated using the LungMAP SPARQL API, which returns this grouping metadata in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) labeled graph format for each queried image. The grouping simplifies image segmentation, since images within a set are now homogeneous with respect to extrinsic variables.


In summary, application ontologies can be powerful tools to pair with immunofluorescent image processing, segmentation and object identification.
