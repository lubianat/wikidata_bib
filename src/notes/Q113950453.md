# Highlights

As more and more publications are becoming available in full text and in machine readable formats through repositories like Europe PubMed Central, we propose to mine the literature for ethics statements and to extract information about the various aspects of research ethics that they address. The more standardized these statements are, the better the mined materials can be converted into structured and queryable information that can in turn be used to inform efforts towards higher levels of standardization in research ethics. This paper sketches out the motivation for such mining and outlines some methodological approaches that could be leveraged towards this end.

First, we use pygetpapers (Garg et al. 2022) to identify suitable articles and to download their XML
Next, we use docanalysis to decompose each articleâ€™s XML into sections that can be analyzed independently

For   instance,   ethics-related  terms that have a MeSH Descriptor - e.g.ethical review, ethics committee,animal care committee, informed consent and consent form, or the Declaration of Helsinki - all have a Wikidata entry, as do related terms that do not have a MeSH Descriptor, e.g. ethical approval, ethical oversight, or theNagoya Protocol. Good coverage of ethics-related terms can also be found in the Informed Consent Ontology.

Beyond ethics statements, we plan to apply the ideas outlined here also to   other   non-traditional   parts   of   research   manuscripts,   e.g.   data  availability or conflicts of interest, and we will explore how they can assist with   the   enrichment   of   mining   efforts   targeted   at   relatively   uncommon  elements of traditional manuscript parts, e.g. the citation of data, software and material resources, particularly those that are openly available.
