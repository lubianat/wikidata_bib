# Highlights

This comment discusses the benefits of representing and reusing the information in Electronic Health Record databases as knowledge graphs in the RDF format based on the FHIR RDF specification. 

Structured EHRs can be easily federated with other biomedical knowledge resources, particularly open
knowledge graphs like Wikidata (Turki, et al., 2022a) and Open Biomedical Ontologies (Konopka, 2015).
As biomedical knowledge resources include background knowledge for clinical research and practice,
they can be easily mirrored and then reused to drive evidence-based clinical decisions for patient
management, including disease diagnosis and prognosis, risk factor identification, medical
prescription, and drug interaction identification (Callahan, Tripodi, Pielke-Lombardo, & Hunter, 2020). 


To sum up, shifting to the use of electronic health records in RDF format driven by semantic resources
can be a huge leap into the beginning of a new category of sustainable and explainable artificial
intelligence for clinical practice that benefits not only from the latest advances in machine learning but
also on semantic web technologies for healthcare data integration and reasoning. T
