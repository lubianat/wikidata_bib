# Highlights
Currently, this database is comprised of 607 PCR primer pairs designed for the amplification of various genes conferring resistance to antibiotics representing 10 classes of antimicrobial agents. 

o validate the utility and correctness of the information collected in the LCPDb-ARG, selected primer pairs were tested in bioinformatic and experimental PCR surveys. To our knowledge, this is the first database designed to facilitate PCR monitoring of the occurrence and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental and clinical samples. 

Amongst various pristine and anthropogenically-shaped environments, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are recognized as a location where microorganisms are subjected to numerous environmental stressors. 

In addition, none of the other databases offers an internal validation model that enables the quantified ranking of primer pairs that facilitates selection of the best possible PCR primers for a particular purpose.
