# Highlights

 To address this, we first generated a healthy reference multi-omics single cell data set from children (n=30) in whom we have profiled triple matched samples: nasal and tracheal brushings and PBMCs, where we track the developmental changes for 42 airway and 31 blood cell populations from infancy, through childhood to adolescence. T

 
 his has revealed the presence of naive B and T lymphocytes in neonates and infants with a unique gene expression signature bearing hallmarks of innate immunity.

 We found striking differences: children with  COVID-19  as  opposed  to  adults  had  a  higher  proportion  of  innate  lymphoid  and  non-clonally  expanded  naive  T  cells  in  peripheral  blood,  and  a  limited  interferon-response signature. In the airway epithelium, we found the highest viral load in goblet and ciliated cells and  describe  a  novel  inflammatory  epithelial  cell  population.

To  address  these  gaps  in  our  knowledge  and  to  identify  paediatric-specific  responses  in COVID-19, we collected matched nasal, tracheal, bronchial and blood samples from patients across  infancy,  childhood,  adolescence  and  adulthood  and  analysed  them  with  single  cell transcriptomics  combined  with  protein  profiling

We have assembled a cohort of 30 healthy children from the five World Health Organisation (WHO) age ranges -neonates (0-30 days; n=6), infants (1-24 months; n=6), young children (2-6  years;  n=8),  children  (6-12  years;  n=5),  adolescents  (12-18  years;  n=5) -and  profiled  the cellular landscape in the upper airways (nasal and tracheal brushings) and matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from blood using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Figure 1a-b)

For the upper airways, we generated 138,688 high quality single cell transcriptomes. Of these 115,726 were epithelial and 22,962 immune cells (Figure 1c, Extended Data Figure 2)
or  PBMCs  we  obtained  317,854  cells  ofwhich  181,346  were  isolated  from  COVID-19 patients (Figure 1e)


 In our cell type annotation, we used a conservative approach, using a high cut-off of 1000 UMIs per cell and normalising the data set by donor identity which ensures that cell type differences are consistent between individuals.

 We identified a small number of melanocytes, in keeping with previously reported primary nasal mucosal melanocytes


 Within the ciliated cluster, the differentiation trajectory points from ciliated 1 (PIFO, OMG) to ciliated 2 (CFAP54, DZIP1L) cells. Between the secretory and ciliated clusters, we observe deuterosomal cells as intermediates which are marked by CDC20and FOXN443,

 Distinguishing  markers  are  two  long  non-coding  RNAs,  FP671120.4  and  FP236383.2. This population has not been described in previous analyses of adult airways

Airway epithelial cell type composition does not change extensively with age (Figure 2f, Extended Data Figure 4c) but notably with location, with an increase  in  goblet  2  and  secretory  cells  in  the  nose  compared  to  bronchi  and  trachea


 The  IRC  makers ISG15, IFIT1and CXCL10were widely expressed in all three data sets, but only associated with transitioning cells in the Chua et al data  set.  The  inflammatory  epithelial  transit  cell  (IETC)  markers SAA1, S100A8and S100A9were found in transitioning cells in both upper airway data sets, but less obviously in transitioning  populations  in  the  bronchial  data  se

To  validate  our  manual  cell  type annotation and assess its accuracy, we compared it to an automated annotation by Azimuth6210
This revealed that our annotation was highly similar, but not identical to automated annotation (Extended Data Figure 8b)


 In  addition,  markers  that  point to  a  more innate-like type of immune response, such as CD9and CD1c, which are associated with the marginal zone (MZ) B cell subtype65, are expressed at a higher level in neonates.

Such changes in  the characteristics  of  circulating  B  cells  at  a  very  young  age  might  also  be  linked  to  the formation of structures like the marginal zone, which is not fully developed until 2 years of age66. Together our data suggests that naive T and B cells that have already entered circulation continue to develop and mature during the first year after birth.

Viral infections are cleared by cell death and removal of infected cells77,78, which led to a highlydynamic re-structuring of the airway epithelium with a  marked  increase  in  developmental  intermediates,  most  notably  the  novel  inflammatory epithelial transit cell (IETC) population, which was not found in previous analysis of healthy adult airways
