# Highlights

Determining the specific type of hematopoietic lesion
produced in a mouse model and identifying mouse models that correspond to the human subtypes
of these lesions has been a continuing challenge for the scientific community. The Mouse Tumor
Biology Database (MTB; http://tumor.informatics.jax.org) is designed to facilitate use of mouse
models of human cancer


Human lymphoma subtypes cited in scientific literature include Burkitt, Hodgkin, mucosal
associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), anaplastic, centroblastic, diffuse large B cell (DLBCL),
follicular, histiocytic, immunoblastic, lymphoblastic, lymphocytic, myeloid, non-Hodgkin,
plasmablastic, and plasmacytic.

Systematic classification of
mouse hematopoietic lesions was first described in 1954 (Dunn, 1954). Subsequent
classification systems relied on comparison to established human systems (Fredrickson et
al., 1995; Pattengale and Taylor, 1983).
