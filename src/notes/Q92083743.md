Age minimally changes the neural stem cell transcriptome

 Single-cell transcriptomics of NSCs indicate that aging changes NSCs minimally. In the aging brain, niche-derived inflammatory signals and the Wnt antagonist sFRP5 induce quiescence. Indeed, intervention to neutralize them increases activation of old NSCs during homeostasis and following injury.

The assumption of time-constant parameters, called “no-aging” scenario, led to an exponential decay of the total NSC number, which did not match the experimental observation of saturation of the decline of NSC numbers at an older age 

we assumed that qNSCs can enter cell cycle to become aNSCs and give rise to either two qNSCs or two TAPs with the capacity of performing n symmetric self-renewing divisions (Figure 1D).

We next asked if qNSCs are equally able to become activated upon injury in the young and old brain. To this end, we ablated cycling cells including aNSCs, TAPs, and neuroblasts (NBs) using temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA-alkylating agent (Figure 2A). This ablation activates qNSCs to replenish the NSC compartment (Mich et al., 2014).
