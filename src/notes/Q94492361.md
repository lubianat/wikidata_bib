# Highlights
Conducted single cell RNA sequencing of brainstem of wildtype and mutant SOD1 mice.

Uncovered major known cell types and previously uncharacterized neuron subtypes.

We isolated 1894 and 3199 cells from the brainstem of wildtype and mutant SOD1 symptomatic mice respectively, at postnatal day 100. We recovered major known cell types and neuronal subpopulations, such as interneurons and motor neurons

Barcoded single cells, or STAMPs (single-cell transcriptomes attached to microparticles), and cDNA libraries were prepared as described previously (Macosko et al., 2015) and in version 3.1 of the Drop-Seq Laboratory Protocol available online

The Seurat R package (version 3; https://github.com/satijalab/seurat) was used to project all sequenced cells onto two dimensions using t-SNE (Van Der Maaten and Hinton, 2008)

In this first high-throughput single cell transcriptome study of the brainstem using a SOD1 mutant ALS model, we characterized thousands of cells representing the majority of the brainstem cell types. We identified cell types that show sensitivity to the SOD1 mutation, as well as, cell-type specific genes and pathways altered in the mutant, thus recapitulating both known ALS genes and pathways and revealing novel ones that warrant further investigation.
