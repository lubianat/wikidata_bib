# Highlights
Metabolic control analysis, co-invented by Reinhart Heinrich, is a formalism for the analysis of biochemical networks, and is a highlyimportant intellectual forerunner of modern systems biology. Exchanging ideas and exchanging models are part of the internationalactivities of science and scientists, and the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) allows one to perform the latter with greatfacility. 

om-munity discussion began in earnest, culminating so far inthe massively important Systems Biology Markup Lan-guage (SBML) (Hucka et al., 2003)(www.sbml.org). Morespecifically, a mailing list entitled MMFF (metabolic modelfile format) was set up by one of us (P.M.) in April 1999,just after Visegrad.

SBML, now at level 2 version 3, allows one to describeaccurately the structure of most models in which there isnot  a  highly  complex  spatial  segregation  within  acompartment nor combinatorial variants of, e.g., proteinphosphorylation states. SBML is an XML (eXtensibleMarkup Language) that allows one to describe facts in aprincipled way by marking them up in a standardized‘language’. As well as allowing the exchange of models,SBML provides a very convenient means for storing themin model databases such as Biomodels (www.biomodels.net)(Le Nove`re et al., 2006).
