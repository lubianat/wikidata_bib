# Highlights

We present algorithms to estimate the evolutionary time (tMRS) to the most recent substitution event from a multiple alignment column by using a probabilistic model of sequence evolution. 

We identified a number of human genomic sites at which the last substitutions occurred between two speciation events in the human lineage with confidence.

We have developed algorithms to infer the time tMRS to most recent substitution in the lineage from a given target species to the root of a phylogenetic tree. In order to filter out highly conserved sites and ambiguous sites where the confidence of estimated tMRS is low, we also compute the probability q of no mutation and the standard deviation Ïƒ of tMRS.
