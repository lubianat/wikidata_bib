# Highlights

The roles of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and circulating endothelial progenitors (CEPs) are currently being investigated in several diseases including cancer and metastases development. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that CEC enumeration might be useful to identify patients who might benefit from anti-angiogenic treatments while CEPs seem to have a “catalytic” role in different steps of cancer progression and recurrence after therapy. The definition of CEC and CEP phenotypes and the standardization of CEC and CEP enumeration procedures are highly warranted to use these cells as biomarkers in clinical trials in oncology, and to compare results from different studies.

The evaluation of CEC kinetic in tumor-bearing mice and in cancer patients
treated with anti-angiogenic drugs confirmed that these cells are interesting
surrogate biomarkers of angiogenesis and of the preclinical and clinical activity of
anti-angiogenic drugs

Based on past observations, it is possible assign to CECs and CEPs two different
roles and two separate fields of clinical investigation.
Some CEPs (along with other hematopoietic cells) appear to have a transient
‘‘catalytic’’ but critical role in promoting angiogenesis during tumor growth, in
stimulating growth of micro- to macro-metastases, and in ‘rebound’ revasculari-
zation after certain therapies are stopped. These cells are potentially promising
targets for anti-cancer therapies and for adjuvant therapeutic strategies in patients
at risk for cancer relapse.
