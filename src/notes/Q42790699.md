# Highlights
. The central aim of the meeting was to discuss the issues of coordinating gene naming
across vertebrates, culminating in the publication of recommendations for assigning nomenclature to genes across
multiple species. 

He was followed by Janan
Eppig, principal investigator of the MGI, who, in
her talk, ‘What’s in a Name’, told us about current
nomenclature issues and activities for the mouse.

Guidelines for the naming of genes across vertebrates should be published; these will build
on current guidelines and include basic rules
for the naming of paralogues;

A list of complex gene families, which will
require expert manual curation for cross-species
nomenclature, should be compiled;
† Potential funding should be sought for curation
of the nomenclature of these complex gene
families and the construction of a database framework for superfamily nomenclature;

The formation of novel species-specific gene
nomenclature committees should be encouraged, with the aim of at least one per order for
mammals;
