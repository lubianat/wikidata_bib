# Highlights

However, the simultaneous clustering approach underlying these methods is fundamentally flawed. This is due to what statisticians call the ‘curse of dimensionality’ (REF. 2), which is well known to compromise both the statistical validity and the computa-tional performance of clustering methods that operate on multiple dimensions at once.

when  t-SNE  is  applied  to  high-dimensional  data  with  intrinsi-cally  high  dimensional  structure  (that  is,  when N dimensional data cannot be closely approximated by some combination of n<<Ndimensions), it becomes subject to the curse of  dimensionality7

he curse of dimensionality thus clearly mitigates against the use of high-dimensional simultaneous clustering methods for flow and mass cytometry data analysis. In contrast, automation9 of sequential analysis methods  that have been used for years offers statisti-cally robust clustering and readily usable tools for flow cytometry and other technologies.
