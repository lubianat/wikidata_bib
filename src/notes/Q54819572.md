# Highlights

We present here a QA component to answer questions over DBpedia and Wikidata that can answer both full and keyword natural language questions. It is integrated in the Qanary Ecosystem[4] so that first, it can be easily reused by the research community and second, it takes advantage of the services available in Qanary.

While many systems are querying DBpedia, we are only aware of one system querying wikidata, namely Platypus.

Qanary is a framework to integrate QA components with the goal to make existing research in the QA field reusable. 

Finally Qanary has an interface that allows QA pipelines to be evaluated using Gerbil for QA 6. This means that WDAqua-core0 can be evaluated by the research community at all time especially when new benchmarks arise.
