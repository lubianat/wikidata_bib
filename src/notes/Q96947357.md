# Highlights
The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB).

The IEDB houses the most extensive collection of experimentally validated B-cell and T-cell epitope data,
sourced primarily from published literature by expert curation. The data
procurement requires systematic identiﬁcation, categorization, curation
and quality-checking processes. Here, we provide insights into these pro-
cesses, with particular focus on the dividends they have paid in terms of
attaining project milestones, as well as how objective analyses of our pro-
cesses have identiﬁed opportunities for process optimization.

a searchable
resource housing not only the sequence and chemical
structures of epitopes, but also the actual primary data and metadata associated with them.

The outcome of the queries above is a combined list of
potentially relevant PMIDs. An automated document clas-

next processes the list of retrieved records to generate
a binary curatability assessment, referred to as ‘curatable’
and ‘uncuratable’. 

The DST is a web-based portal (http://dst.liai.org)
designed to facilitate the upload of large-scale epitope data
directly into the IEDB curation interface
