# Highlights

However, the signals that direct ILC2s to promote homeostasis versus inflammation are unclear. To identify such molecular cues, we profiled mouse lung-resident ILCs using single-cell RNA sequencing at steady state and after in vivo stimulation with the alarmin cytokines IL-25 and IL-33. 

Given the increased prevalence of allergy and asthma, identifying the molecular pathways that modulate the response of type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) to alarmins is an important area of inquiry.

The neuropeptide receptor Nmur1 was preferentially expressed by ILC2s at steady state and after IL-25 stimulation. Neuromedin U (NMU), the ligand of NMUR1, activated ILC2s in vitro, and in vivo co-administration of NMU with IL-25 strongly amplified allergic inflammation.

Thus, NMUR1 signalling promotes inflammatory ILC2 responses, highlighting the importance of neuro-immune crosstalk in allergic inflammation at mucosal surfaces

o define the transcriptional landscape of lung-resident ILCs, we collected 24,187 high-quality, droplet-based scRNA-seq profiles of ILCs (IL-7Ra+CD90+ and lacking lineage markers) at steady state

we profiled mouse lung-resident ILCs using single-cell RNA sequencing at steady state 

ScRNA-seq identifies Nmur1 as a novel ILC2-specific gene.

Finally, Nmur1-knockout ILC2s had a lower average inflammatory score than wild-type ILC2
