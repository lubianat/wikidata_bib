Effective mapping of biomedical text to the UMLS Metathesaurus: the MetaMap program
===================================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q29614363]  

# Highlights
Many researchers have developed programs to map free text to a biomedical knowledge source including NLM's MeSHY vocabulary and, more recently, the UMLS Metathesaurus.

The MetaMap approach [8-1 1] to mapping text is distin- guished by its linguistic rigor and reliance on knowl- edge sources such as the SPECIALISTTh lexicon [12]. We describe the algorithm used by MetaMap, enumerate some of the applications in which MetaMap is being used and discuss current efforts to improve its accuracy.

Research has shown that MetaMap is an effective tool for discovering Metathesaurus concepts in text. But there are two areas in which MetaMap's performance requires improvement: first, detection of idiosyncratic text such as chemical names, acronyms and abbrevia- tions, numeric quantities or similar constructs; and second, resolution of ambiguity.
