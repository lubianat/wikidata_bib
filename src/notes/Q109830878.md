# Highlights

With 90 million entities and
1.4 billion revision made by 20 thousand active users2
, Wikidata is the prime
example of an evolving knowledge graph. In this paper, we present Wikidated 1.0,
an evolving knowledge graph dataset covering the full revision history of Wikidata.
To the best of our knowledge, Wikidated 1.0 is the first large dataset of an evolving
knowledge graph. It records the fine-grained, organic evolution of Wikidata since
its inception in 2012 until June 2021. 

It is suited for research into how knowledge
graphs and their communities change over time—specifically for Wikidata, such
as done in Sarasua et al. [27]—and enables reproducible evaluation environments
for indexing and representation approaches of evolving knowledge graphs, such
as incremental knowledge graph embedding [37,6].

We publicly release Wikidated 1.0 in two variants, the code base used to
built it, and a Python API to access it1

Fundamentally, Wikidated 1.0 is a transformation from a Wikidata dump’s stream
of revisions into a stream of incremental revisions. We define an incremental
revision as a tuple of the (1) entity metadata (the entity ID and some Wikidata
internal fields), and the (2) revision metadata (the revision ID and when and by
whom it was authored) of the Wikidata revision it is based upon, as well as sets
of (3) RDF triple deletions and (4) RDF triple additions in comparison to the
previous revision of the respective entity

While approaches for storing
differences between RDF graphs in RDF itself exist [3,20], we hereby opt for a
less Semantic-Web-oriented distribution format, because we feel that it allows
for easier consumption by most users. We are open to releasing the dataset in
RDF later (based on community demand).

The file size of the global-stream variant of Wikidated 1.0 is 239 GiB whereas
the tar archive for the entity-streams variant is 329 GiB (both gzip-compressed)

Further future work includes deeper analysis of the editing dynamics of
Wikidata recorded in Wikidated 1.0, such as detecting updates from sets of
triple deletions and additions, or classifying the type and source of changes; and
consideration of Wikidata’s more recent lexicographic data, the first step towards
this would be to implement a RDF serialization of it in Wikidata Toolkit. We invite
the Wikimedia Foundation specifically to consider also releasing official Wikidata
dumps in an incremental format—such as the one used for Wikidated 1.0—in
order to save bandwidth and storage space for users
