# Highlights
We show that Repertoire and Gene Expression by Sequencing
(RAGE-Seq) can generate accurate full-length antigen receptor sequences at nucleotide
resolution, infer B-cell clonal evolution and identify alternatively spliced BCR transcripts. We
apply RAGE-Seq to 7138 cells sampled from the primary tumor and draining lymph node of a
breast cancer patient

To apply
our method to primary B and T lymphocytes, we performed
RAGE-Seq on a tumor and paired lymph node resected from a
triple negative breast cancer patient. In the lymph node, we
identified 4165 T cells that could be subdivided into seven T-cell
populations

he adaptability of RAGE-Seq
across multiple scRNA-Seq platforms and the flexibility to target
a range of genes offers a new genomic toolkit for advanced single
cell analysis.
