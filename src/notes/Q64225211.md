# Highlights

 The expressivity of ShEx allows us to catch disagreement, inconsistencies, or errors efficiently, both at the time of input, and through batch inspections.

 The need to describe the topologies, or shapes, of RDF graphs triggered the creation of an early version of Shape Expressions (ShEx 1) and the formation of a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Working Group—the Data Shapes Working Group—in 2014 [15]. Its task was to recommend a technology for describing and expressing structural constraints on RDF graphs. This has led to SHACL [8]–another shape-based data validation language for RDF–and further development of ShEx.

 pyShEx. PyShExFootnote12 is a Python 3 implementation of the ShExFootnote13 specification. It uses the underlying model behind the ShEx JSON format (ShExJ)Footnote14 as the abstract syntax tree (AST), meaning that ShEx schemas in the JSON format can be directly loaded and processed. PyShEx uses the PyShExC parser

 .2 Domain-Generic ShEx Validation in Wikidata
What Wikipedia is to text, Wikidata is to data: an open collaboratively curated resource that anyone can contribute to. In contrast to the language-specific Wikipedias, Wikidata is Semantic Web-compatible, and most of the edits are made using automated or semi-automated tools. 

ShEx is used as a communication tool to express the data model being discussed. For instance, https://github.com/SuLab/Genewiki-ShEx/blob/master/genes/wikidata-human-genes.shex contains the data model of a human gene as depicted in Wikidata (note the many uses of the comment sign “#”). 

The usage of ShEx in WikiCite is currently experimental, with tests being performed via the ShEx2 Simple Online Validator.
