To directly assess the controversy surrounding the neuro-
genic capacity of ependymal cells, we developed a novel
transgenic mouse model for the widespread targeting of
ependymal cells at the exclusion of neural lineages within
the postnatal V-SVZ. Contradictory to recent suggestions
(Luo et al., 2015), we find ependymal cells at large are Flt1,
FN1-negative and have a remarkable lack of stemness or
neurogenic capacity in vivo. We also find that ependymal
cells have a distinct transcriptional signature, enriched for
cilia-related genes, despite sharing a number of stem-cell-
associated genes with neural stem and progenitor cells.
These findings suggest the remarkable stability of ependymal
cell function and provide fundamental insights into the molec-
ular signature of the V-SVZ niche
