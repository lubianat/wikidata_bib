# Highlights
Partindo de um pequeno grupo  de  investigadores,  extraímos  dados  do  nosso CurrentResearch Information System (CRIS) que depois importámos   para   a   Wikidata.

Lemus-Rojas  and  Pintscher  (2018)  urge  information professionals to use their expertise to contribute to Wikidata. The authors point to the experience of these  professionals  in  the  creation  and  implementation  of  standards,  as  well  as  their  “deep appreciation and understanding of the value of creating structured metadata” (Lemus-Rojas  and Pintscher, 2018, p.150).

It is also necessary to define a Wikidata schema, which corresponds to the way the data is structured in  Wikidata.  The  data  edited  in  OpenRefine  was  then  exported  to  QuickStatements  format.  With QuickStatements it is possible to add and remove statements, labels, descriptions and aliases, as well as create new items. The data is converted into a sequence of commands, which can be pasted into an editor. Running  the  commands  creates  or modifies  items  and  statements.  We  also  used  SourceMD, that allows for the creation of items corresponding to scholarly articles, using the DOI.

t the end of the pilot, there were 70 NOVA SBE researchers in Wikidata (approximately 35% of the total number of researchers that are affiliated with NOVA SBE). Some profiles are still incomplete, as well  as  the  scientific  production  of  some  researchers,  while  some  of  them  already  have  all  their scientific production on Wikidata. In total, there are already more than 600 scholarly articles and books produced by the School’s researchers.
