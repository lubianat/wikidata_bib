# Highlights

Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across individual cells of mouse preimplantation embryos of mixed background (CAST/EiJ × C57BL/6J)

 We conclude that independent and stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.

 we isolated 269 individ-ual cells dissociated from in vivo F1 embryos(CAST/EiJ × C57BL/6J, hereafter abbreviatedas CASTand C57, respectively) from oocyte toblastocyst stages of mouse preimplantation de-velopment (PD

 We esti-mated that 60% of all polyadenylated [poly (A)+]RNA molecules are lost in the Smart-seq2 protocol(Fig. 3A) (13) because inferred losses stabilized atlevels equal to a single RNA molecule. Thisanalysis uncovered coherent monoallelic expres-sion estimates across independent split-cell ex-periments with a median of 17% of genes (Fig. 3B).

 A) The cumulative fraction ofmonoallelic expression as a function of the expres-sion levels for individual liver cells and at differentdilutions. (B) Percentage of genes with monoallelicexpression in individual cultured adult fibroblasts(C57 × CAST and CAST × C57) for genes with meanexpression≥20 RPKM per stage (fig. S28).

 n this study, we uncovered a stochastic pat-tern of monoallelic expression that differs fromthe stable allelic regulation of genomic imprint-ing and allelic exclusion (22,23). It also differsfrom the stably maintained monoallelic expres-sion observed in clonal lymphoid cell populations(4,5). Instead, the rapid expression dynamics thatwe uncovered in individual cells are consistentwith models of transcriptional bursting (24)
