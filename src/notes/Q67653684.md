# Highlights
Using a combination of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and longitudinal in vivo twophoton calcium imaging, we surveyed functional alterations of the lateral hypothalamic area
(LHA)—a highly conserved brain region that orchestrates feeding—in a mouse model of obesity.
The transcriptional profile of LHA glutamatergic neurons was impacted by obesity, exhibiting
changes indicative of altered neuronal activity
