# Highlights

a single-center report of 416 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 19.7% had evidence of cardiac injury, suggesting a possible pathologic role for myocardial ACE2 expression

We aim to shed light on these questions by assessing ACE2 expression by performing bulk and single nucleus RNA-Seq on the left ventricles of 11 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy, 15 individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 16 controls with nonfailing hearts from the Penn Human Heart Tissue Biobank.

Because patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were on an ACEi whereas controls with nonfailing hearts were not, our ability to examine effects of ACEi use was limited to the patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (6 taking an ACEi, 8 not taking an ACEi)


These data suggest that previous cardiovascular disease is a predominant driver of cardiomyocyte-specific increased transcription of ACE2. These findings may provide a pathologic link for SARS-CoVâ€“associated viral myocarditis.

--> More or less, the results seem a bit mixed
