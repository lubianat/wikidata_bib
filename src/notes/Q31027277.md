# Highlights

•
NDEx (www.ndexbio.org) is an online commons for biological networks
•
Users can upload, share, and distribute networks of many types, sizes, and formats
•
Developers can access NDEx via a web-based programming interface
•
NDEx promotes the publication of networks as dynamic, actionable data

 NDEx, the Network Data Exchange (www.ndexbio.org), is an online commons where scientists can upload, share, and publicly distribute networks. Networks in NDEx receive globally unique accession IDs and can be stored for private use, shared in pre-publication collaboration, or released for public access.

 NDEx, the Network Data Exchange, is an open-source (Data S1, Open Source) software framework that facilitates the sharing of networks of many types and formats, the publication of networks as data, and the use of networks in modular software.

The shared networks preserve the distinct semantics of their original formats while standardizing the treatment of identifiers, citations, properties, and network topology (Figure 1B; Data S1, Data Model). NDEx therefore differs in approach from WikiPathways (Pico et al., 2008), a pioneering collaborative platform for the curation of biological pathways, where all documents are edited publically and use a single format.

In summary, NDEx provides distinctive capabilities as a data commons to further the use of biological networks in scientific discourse. It promotes the development of modular applications and the re-use of research products by creating a network exchange where the outputs from one project or application can readily become inputs to another. The NDEx platform is enabling new forms of publication and collaboration in which network information can be immediately analyzed, visualized, annotated, and shared.
