# Highlights

To address the needs of the heart development research community, this study aimed to describe the specific roles of proteins reported in the literature to be involved with CCS development and/or function. 14 proteins were prioritized for GO annotation which led to the curation of 15 peer-reviewed primary experimental articles using carefully selected GO terms. 

The electrical cardiac conduction system (CCS) consists of the sinoatrial node (SAN), atrioventricular node (AVN) and the ventricular conduction system (VCS). The VCS can be divided into the following discrete components: bundle of His (or atrioventricular bundle (AVB)), which bifurcates into the left bundle branch (LBB) and right bundle branch (RBB) and the distal Purkinje fiber network (PFN), as reviewed in detail by Kennedy et al. (2016)

The Gene Ontology Consortium provides two publicly available resources: a structured, controlled vocabulary, the Gene Ontology (http://geneontology.org/) (Ashburner et al., 2000) and a database of biological knowledge regarding the functions of genes and gene products in a written and computable form (The Gene Ontology Consortium 2019).

A total of 99 GO annotations were created as a result of annotating 15 papers (https://tinyurl.com/puxypjyv, Supplementary Table S3).
