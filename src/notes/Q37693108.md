# Highlights

There are four major cell types in healthy nasal epithelium, including basal cells, ciliated cells, non-ciliated columnar cells and goblet cells11. Basal cells are considered to have stemness and progenitor properties, which can self-renew and differentiate into other epithelial cell types12,13. In our recent study, we have successfully isolated and cultured human nasal epithelial stem/progenitor cells (hNESPCs) from human inferior turbinate tissues in a serum-free culture method14. This technical advance facilitates studies on the pathological mechanisms underlying abnormal epithelial repair and remodeling in inflammatory airway diseases, such as NP.
