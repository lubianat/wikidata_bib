# Highlights
Spiral ligament fibrocytes at a given position along the cochlea
varied in content of transport related enzymes, and on the basis of immunostaining, location and orientation, were classified into four types.

CA has been demonstrated immunocytochemically
in diverse cell types in the vestibular system including
fibrocytes underlying neurosensory epithelium and dark
cells (Spicer et al., 1990) where it presumably partici-
pates in maintenance of ion balance between peri-
lymph and endolymph. However, little is known about
the distribution of CA in the cochlea beyond its pre-
sumed localization with enzyme cytochemical methods
in the stria vascularis and spiral ligament fibrocytes as
well as many other cell types (Lim et al., 1983; Watan-
abe and Ogawa, 1984; Hsu and Nomura, 1985).
