# Highlights

We identified discrete cell types as well astemporally and spatially restricted trajectories of radial glia maturation and neurogenesisin developing human telencephalon. These lineage-specific trajectories reveal theexpression of neurogenic transcription factors in early radial glia and enriched activationof mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in outer radial glia. 

Together, our results support a mixed model oftopographical, typological, and temporal hierarchies governing cell-type diversity in thedeveloping human telencephalon, including distinct excitatory lineages emerging in rostraland caudal cerebral cortex.

We performed single-cell mRNA sequencing(scRNA-seq) in primary cortical and medial gan-glionic eminence (MGE) samples across stagesof peak neurogenesis (tables S1 to S3)

sing unbiased clustering, we identified tran-scriptionally distinct cell clusters correspondingto 11 broad categories: astrocytes, oligodendrocyteprecursor cells, microglia, radial glia, intermediateprogenitor cells, excitatory cortical neurons, ven-tral MGE progenitors, inhibitory cortical inter-neurons, choroid plexus cells, mural cells, andendothelial cells (Fig. 1, B to D; figs. S2 to S4; andtables S4 and S5).

. To resolve finer dis-tinctions among cells and to relate gene expres-sion variation to cell type, developmental stage,and anatomical source, we performed weightedgene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA)(fig. S3 and tables S6 and S7) (8). 

--> Interesting, I did not get the annotations in full, though.


Thus, based on tran-scriptomic signatures, radial glia follow a topo-graphical hierarchy to distinguish dorsal andventral telencephalic lineages, but within the dor-sal telencephalon, radial glia appear to follow atypological hierarchy.

o compare ra-dial glia in these laminae across maturation stages,we combined gene coexpression networks cor-related with radial glia sampled from micro-dissected VZ and OSVZ to define a lamina score,or“pseudolamina”(Fig. 2F and fig. S6). Genecoexpression networks correlated with pseudo-lamina and pseudoage not only supported thisclassification of radial glia subtypes (14,15)butalso highlighted selective activation of signalingpathways

--> Nice! That is pretty much the idea of fcoex; - 0.1 fcoex & FCBF

Distinct neuronal cell types havebeen proposed to arise through divergence ofserial sister lineages from ancestral differentiationprograms (23). Single-cell sequencing enables thedisambiguation of these cell type–specific differ-entiation trajectories across related lineages

 Thesetransformations recovered known gene expres-sion trajectories conserved throughout neuro-genesis (for example,GLI3toEOMEStoSTMN2in cortex), as well as parallel trajectories ofdifferentiation that segregate by maturation stage(Fig. 3E and fig. S8).
