# Highlights
 interoperability between biomedical computer systems. We show the data model and characteristics of Wikidata and explain how this database can be automatically processed by users as well as by computer methods and programs. Then, we give an overview of the medical entities and relations provided by the database and how they can be useful for various medical purposes such as clinical decision support.

Non-taxonomic associative relations (e.g. “drug used for treatment” and “risk factor”) should create a further link between medical concepts to give biomedical computer programs the ability to clinically analyze provided input

n the other hand, several existing ontologies are incompatible with one other because they cover different fields of interest or because they use different systems

Here, we raise awareness of the potential use of Wikidata as a useful resource for biomedical data integration and semantic interoperability between biomedical computer systems [30].

As a large-scale knowledge graph, Wikidata consists of two types of entities: items (e.g.: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q193216 for Trachoma [Q193216]) and properties (e.g.: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P2176 for drug used for treatment [P2176]) [71]

The interface is designed such that computer programming skills are useful but not necessary – since users can still automatically enrich Wikidata with their own dataset or knowledge or query it to answer questions, including medical ones [42]. Effectively, the user can use the SPARQL Endpoint of Wikidata6 [42].
