Throughoutthisperiodofchange,theWorldHealthOrganisation’sInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD) family of classifications[35] continued on their own course, largely unaffected.

n parallel, in the early 2000s, the philosophical ontologist BarrySmithbegantotakethelinkbetweenontologyininformationsystemsand philosophical ontology more seriously. Conveniently, much, butnot all, of what Smith advocated for “ontologies” corresponded withwhat OWL/Description Logics could represent. However, Smith alsoadvocated additional constraints based on his “realist” school of phi-losophical ontology and some statements that fell outside OWL’s re-strictions [28]. In particular, Smith excluded classes for which no ex-amples existed in the real world,e.g.“manned mars mission.” ThoseinterestedintheensuingcontroversiesshouldseeMerrill’scritiqueandtheensuingpapers[29,30]

Whethertouse“relation”or“relationship”iscontroversial.Wefollowusualmathematical practice in using “relation” for the name of the descriptor andavoid “relationship” altogether in favour of “statement.” This is contrary toBodenreider’susage,butwehavefoundtheuseof“relation”and“relationship”togethercausesconfusion[42].
