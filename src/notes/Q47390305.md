# Highlights

 The introduction of "Network Sets" in NDEx 2.0 enables users to create and manage named collections of networks with stable UUIDs, making these collections destinations in their own right. Individuals and organizations can publish documented collections of networks, collections that can even include public networks owned by other users

 The team of scientists also maintains a large, dynamically updated network of inferred molecular relationships, providing an up-to-date data resource without the need for a specialized web portal. The RAS Machine, a software agent developed under the DARPA Big Mechanism program (9), reads literature daily, adds new knowledge to its model of RAS signaling, and publishes the changes as an update to its public NDEx network.
