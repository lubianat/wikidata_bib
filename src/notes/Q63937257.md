# Highlights

We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. 


 The expected number of edges can be expressed as 𝐾2𝑐2𝑚, where Kc is the sum of the degrees of the nodes in community c and m is the total number of edges in the network. This way of defining the expected number of edges is based on the so-called configuration model. Modularity is given by

=12𝑚∑𝑐(𝑒𝑐−𝛾𝐾2𝑐2𝑚),

where γ > 0 is a resolution parameter4. Higher resolutions lead to more communities, while lower resolutions lead to fewer communities.

Disconnected community. Consider the partition shown in (a). When node 0 is moved to a different community, the red community becomes internally disconnected, as shown in (b). However, nodes 1–6 are still locally optimally assigned, and therefore these nodes will stay in the red community
