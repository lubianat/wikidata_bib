# Highlights

Formal  principles  governing  best  practicesin  classification  anddefinition  have  for  too  long  been  neglected  in  the  construction  of  biomedicalontologies,  in  ways  which  have  important  negative  consequences  for  data  integration and ontology alignment. We argue that the use of such principles inontology construction can serve as a valuable tool in error-detection and also insupporting  reliable  manual  curation. 

As  we  shall  see,  GOÃ­s  three  ontologies  are  not  primarily  used  to  support  automated reasoning, but rather as a means by which biologists can easily and rapidly locate  existing  terms  and  relations  within  a  structured  vocabulary  and  so  determine  the proper treatment of new terms when the latter present themselves as candidates for incorporation in biomedical databases. To this end, GO has been highly successful in providing  a  controlled  vocabulary  that  is  used  by  different  research  groups  in  annotating  genes  and  gene  products.
