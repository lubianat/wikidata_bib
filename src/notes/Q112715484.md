# Highlights

Here, in a comprehensive analysis of 6,160 mouse primary motor cortex cells assayed with SMART-seq, 280,327 cells assayed with MERFISH2 and 94,162 cells assayed with 10x Genomics sequencing3, we find examples of isoform specificity in cell types—including isoform shifts between cell types that are masked in gene-level analysis—as well as examples of transcriptional regulation

<!-- Hmm, interesting, challenging to model, though. -->

To identify isoform markers of cell types, we first sought to visualize our SMART-seq data using gene-derived cluster labels from the BICCN analysis

. However, we observed several autosomal isoforms that were differentially expressed between male and female mice. Among these, the Shank1-203 isoform is differential in Vip neurons, a finding that refines previous data showing that Shank1, which has been shown to localize in Purkinje cells in the cortex38, is a sex-specific gene whose expression is regulated by sex hormones39.

 Our findings show that isoform-level expression can help refine cell types in the mouse MOp beyond what is possible using gene-level expression estimates.


  We identified 1,971 isoforms from 128 groups of TSSs where the TSSs are preferentially expressed in either GABAergic, glutamatergic or non-neuronal classes, even when the expression of isoforms contained within the TSS is constant (Supplementary Table 10a, c, d).
