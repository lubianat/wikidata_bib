# Highlights
Pathway-centric approaches are used to interpret and contextualize -omics data.
However, databases contain different representations of the same biological pathway, which may lead to different results of statistical enrichment analysis and predictive models in the context of precision medicine.

Notably, the selection of a suitable pathway database depends on the actual biological context that is investigated, yet KEGG remains severely over-represented in published -omics studies. 
This raises concerns and motivates the consideration of multiple pathway
databases or, preferably, an integration over several pathways resources.

The aim of this work is to systematically investigate the influence of alternative representations of the same biological pathway on the results of statistical enrichment analysis via three common methods: the hypergeometric test, GSEA and Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) using five The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets.

Additionally, cancer subtype classifications or the PRAD and BRCA datasets
were retrieved from the GDC.
We would like to note that although there are other cohorts available (e.g., COAD and
STAD) containing all of these modalities, we did not include them in this analysis because of the limited number of samples they contain (i.e., less than 300 patients).

Detailed statistics of all five datasets are presented in Table 3.
