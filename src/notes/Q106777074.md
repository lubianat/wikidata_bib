# Highlights

We describe several new features in the R implementation, including a test for the detection of co-eluting protein complexes and a method for differential network analysis. PrInCE is extensively documented and fully compatible with Bioconductor classes, ensuring it can fit seamlessly into existing proteomics workflows.

A complete description of the PrInCE workflow is included in the Supplementary Information.


Extensive documentation and tutorial vignettes are included in PrInCE to guide users through its major functionalities. Importantly, unlike other tools for CF-MS data analysis (Hu et al., 2019), PrInCE does not consider any external data sources (e.g. gene coexpression or coevolution) in network inference, increasing its ability to discover novel interactions (Skinnider et al., 2018).
