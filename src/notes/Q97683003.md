# Highlights

Here, relying on China National GeneBank (CNGB), we present CNGB Sequence Archive (CNSA) for archiving omics data, including raw sequencing data and its further analyzed results which are organized into six object
Complying with the data standards commonly used in the life sciences, CNSA is committed to building a comprehensive and curated data repository for storing, managing and sharing of omics data. 

The China National GeneBank (CNGB) [14] was established in January 2011, which is committed to supporting public welfare, life science research, innovation and industry incubation, through effective bioresource conservation, digitalization and utilization

CNSA is the data archiving system of CNGBdb and is built for archiving omics data including not only raw sequencing data but also further analyzed results

Moreover, each data is assigned a corresponding accession number (for example, project: CNP0000126, sample: CNS0020690, experiment: CNX0023584, run: CNR0028196, assembly: CNA0000829)

In addition, new data types associated with the omics data such as sequence, protein, metabolism, expression, clinic and image will be gradually added to the database to enrich our database and meet the needs of more users in the future.
