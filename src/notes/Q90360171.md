# Highlights


Neuronal activity-regulated gene (ARG) expression
enables experience to shape neural circuitry in long-lasting
ways, and the cellular and synaptic functions of several
experience-induced genes have been described. However,
it remains largely unexplored how these genes, or the
activity-induced gene program as a whole, alter the flow
ofinformationinneural circuitsto affect adaptive behaviors
such as learning, stress-resilience or drug-addiction

The vast majority of these immediate early ARGs are
themselves TFs (e.g. Fos/Junb, Npas4, and Egr1-3) but
some of them are effector genes that have functions
other than simply supporting activity-inducible transcription itself (Arc for example directly acts at synapses

Mechanisms that determine the cell-typespecificity of ARG expression

Cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms determine cell-type-specific experience-induced gene programs.

Cell-intrinsic mechanisms determine how different cell-types respond to an identical external stimulus. Such intrinsic mechanisms include celltype-specific membrane-bound receptors, intracellular signal-transduction pathways, and chromatin states (including the presence of cell-typespecific transcriptional activators and repressors). Cell-extrinsic mechanisms are due to the different wiring of different types of neurons: in
response to a single organismal experience, afferent pathways are differentially activated, leading to different neurotransmitters released upon
and/or electrical patterns experienced by different types of postsynaptic neurons.
