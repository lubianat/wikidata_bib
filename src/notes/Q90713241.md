# Highlights
Here, we develop a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based microglial chimeric mouse brain model by transplanting hPSC-derived primitive macrophage progenitors into neonatal mouse brains. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the microglial chimeric mouse brains reveals that xenografted hPSC-derived microglia largely retain human microglial identity

These findings argue for the development of species-specific research tools to investigate microglial functions in human brain development, aging, and neurodegeneration.
