# Highlights
The position of the Touton giant cell in relation to the foreign body and Langhans type of giant cell is considered.

"xanthelasmatic giant cell" of Touton, whose characteristic appearance is determined merely by the presence of demonstrable lipid in the cytoplasm. It is proposed that Touton cells develop when the stimulus to cell fusion is accompanied also by a factor stimulating lipid uptake

1956 - Literature on the Langhans cell alone could no longer be adquately surveyed!
