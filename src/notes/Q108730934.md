Efficient SPARQL Autocompletion via SPARQL
==========================================

Publication date : 29 of April, 2021  

# Highlights

The suggestions are context-sensitive in the
sense that they lead to a non-empty result and are ranked by their
relevance to the part of the query already typed. The suggestions
can be narrowed down by prefix search on the names and aliases of
the desired subject, predicate, or object. All suggestions are themselves obtained via SPARQL queries, which we call autocompletion
queries. For existing SPARQL engines, these queries are impractically slow on large knowledge bases. We present various algorithmic and engineering improvements of an existing SPARQL engine
such that these autocompletion queries are executed efficiently

On Wikidata, we achieve fully sensitive suggestions
with sub-second response times for over 90% of a large and diverse
set of thousands of autocompletion queries. Materials for full reproducibility, an interactive evaluation web app, and a demo are
available on: http://ad.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications.

The largest general-purpose knowledge base to date is Wikidata (6.9B triples,
as of 07-01-2020) [19

or example, consider
the seemingly simple request: the Oscars of Meryl Streep and the
movies she won them for. The correct SPARQL query on Wikidata
is quite complex (an explanation follows below the query).
SELECT ?award ?film WHERE {
wd:Q873 p:P166 ?m .
?m pq:P1686 ?film_id .
?m ps:P166 ?award_id .
?award_id wdt:P31 wd:Q19020 .
?award_id rdfs:label ?award .
?film_id rdfs:label ?film }
The wd:, wdt:, etc. are IRI prefixes. We have omitted their definition here to save space; see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SPARQL/
Prefixes.

Example 3 from Section 1.1 and a continuation not described in the text, for a query on Wikidata, where IRIs are alphanumeric. The assignments below each screenshot show the values of the variables from our problem definition: ùë† (the part of
the SPARQL query already typed), ùë° (the desired token), and ùëù (a prefix of a name or alias of that token). For a live demo, see
