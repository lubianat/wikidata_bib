# Highlights
Lipid-laden cells (initially named lipid-interstitial cells, LIC, and later termed lipofibrobasts, LiF) were first observed in the pulmonary alveolar interstitium of rats and mice during the saccular and alveolar stages of development (7, 10). 

. Comparable to hepatic stellate cells, LiF store retinyl esters, an endogenous precursor for retinoic acid, which supports elastin synthesis and alveolar formation (16). However, an understanding of the function of LiFs was limited by the transient presence of lipid granules and because the cells lost the granules when cultured.

Nearly 50 years after they were first recognized morphologically, LiFs are being recognized as more than epiphenomena or purveyors of surfactant lipids. The study by Park and coworkers (22) is casting a signature role for LiFs as a pivotal alveolar fibroblast subtype that may ultimately lead to new approaches to lung repair and regeneration.
