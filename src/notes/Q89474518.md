# Highlights
Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-based systems offer the possibi-
lity of de novo somatic cell derivation through directed
differentiation, a multistage process recapitulating devel-
opmental milestones

n important intermediate population in lung lineage deriva-
tion from PSCs is the lung epithelial primordial progenitor
population, i.e., the ﬁrst cells within the foregut that are speciﬁed
to a lung epithelial cell fate, but do not yet express markers of
lung epithelial differentiation, such as surfactant genes

Thus, our approach delineates the unique genetic
program of the earliest primordial lung progenitor

Having established that proximal and distal lung epithelia are
derived through an Nkx2-1 + lung epithelial progenitor inter-
mediate, we then sought to develop an approach for the identi-
ﬁcation and isolation of Nkx2-1 + primordial progenitors as they
emerge from foregut endodermal precursors.

Lung primordial progenitors appear to possess a genetic
program quite distinct from both thyroid and forebrain
progenitor populations as well as foregut endoderm, their
precursor population
