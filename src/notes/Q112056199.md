# Highlights
Using single cell RNA sequencing of sorted innate immune cell subsets, we identified two distinct myeloid dendritic cell subsets (NDRG1-expressing mDC2 and CDKN1C-expressing mDC4), the ratio of which at baseline (pre-vaccination) correlated with the immune response to a single dose of HBV vaccine.

Recently, several groups have applied high-throughput multi-omics assays to produce a comprehensive systems-level evaluation of vaccine responses, so-called “systems vaccinology” (reviewed in (2–5). One of the key questions addressed is - can baseline (pre-vaccine) signatures of the immune system predict vaccine responses and differentiate between responders vs. non-responders and, if so, what can these signatures tell us about the mechanisms for eliciting protective immunity (6).


DIABLO, part of the mixOmics framework, is a data-driven, hypothesis-free multi-omics integration approach that has been successfully applied, by us and others, to derive novel, robust biomarkers, and increase our understanding of the molecular regulatory mechanisms that underlie health and disease (31–34).

. Expression of FCGR3A in the main mDC cluster and FCER1A in the outlier mDC cluster suggests that these two subsets correspond to the DC4 and DC2 dendritic cell types defined previously (37) and will be referred to as CDKN1C-expressing mDC4 and NDRG2-expressing mDC2.
