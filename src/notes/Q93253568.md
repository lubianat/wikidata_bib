# Highlights
To better understand how a regenerative program is fulfilled by neural progenitor cells (NPCs) of the spinal cord, we analyzed pax6-expressing NPCs isolated from regenerating Xenopus tropicalis tails. By intersecting chromatin accessibility data with single-cell transcriptomics, we find that NPCs place an early priority on neuronal differentiation.

In contrast to mammals, Xenopus tadpoles are able to undergo scarless healing and full regeneration of the limb, spinal cord, or tail after injury (Beck et al., 2009; Kakebeen and Wills, 2019; Lee-Liu et al., 2017; Tseng and Levin, 2008). While lifelong regenerative healing is a characteristic shared by many amphibians and fish, the regenerative capacity of Xenopus declines during metamorphosis, and is lost in the adult (Filoni and Bosco, 1981; Mitogawa et al., 2015; Suzuki et al., 2006).

Thus we concluded that we could use GFP expression to capture a large proportion of NPCs and thereby interrogate their population-level regulatory dynamics, although we canâ€™t conclusively rule out the possibility that some NSCs are excluded from this domain, or that some differentiated neurons may be included in GFP-expressing cells.
