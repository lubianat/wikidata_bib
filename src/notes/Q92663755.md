# Highlights
A multidirectional relationship has been demonstrated between myocardial infarction (MI) and depression. However, the causal genetic factors and molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction remain unclear. 

Using a bioinformatics approach and existing gene expression data in the biomedical discovery support system (BITOLA), we defined the starting concept X as “Myocardial Infarction” and end concept Z as “Major Depressive Disorder” or “Depressive disorder”. All intermediate concepts relevant to the “Gene or Gene Product” for MI and depression were searched. 

GNB3, CNR1, MTHFR, and NCAM1 are putative new candidate genes that may influence the interactions between MI and depression, and may represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

Looks amateurish.
