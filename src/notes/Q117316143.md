# Highlights

NDEx and Cytoscape are the pillars of the Cytoscape Ecosystem, a diverse environment of resources,tools, applications and services for network biology workflows

Finally, we show how NDEx can be used programmatically via Pythonwith the ‘ndex2’ client library, and point readers to additional examples forother popular programming languages such as JavaScript and R.


In this first protocol, we will introduce the fundamental aspects of the NDEx web userinterface (hereafter, NDEx UI) and prepare the ground for the “real world” use casespresented in Basic Protocols 2, 3, and 4. You will learn to use the NDEx UI to searchfor networks, become familiar with the NDEx Network Viewer (NNV), and create yourown NDEx account.

When searching for genes, you can decide to activate Search Term Expansion by markingthe available checkbox: this feature will expand your search terms to include all possiblealiases, thus returning networks that contain your genes of interest even if they have unof-ficial names. This feature only works for human genes. Mouse over the small blue icon todisplay a tooltip with additional information.
