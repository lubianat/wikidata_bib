# Highlights

The first component of our annotation interface is the gene prioritization interface that ranks gene products for annotation. Biocurators select the top-ranked gene and mark annotation for these genes as ‘in progress’ or ‘completed’;

This enables AgBase biocurators to rapidly identify literature for further curation based on possible GO terms. Because most agricultural species do not have standardized literature, eGIFT searches all gene names and synonyms to associate articles with genes

The AgBase BI also supports bulk annotation upload to facilitate our Inferred from electronic annotation of agricultural gene products. All annotations must pass standard GO Consortium quality checking before release in AgBase.

--> Now HPIDB3.0

The GP Interface. The GP Interface is used to direct biocurator’s annotation to genes that the community see as requiring annotation. 

Another novel tool that we use to focus our manual biocuration effort is the eGIFT tool (3). eGIFT is a web-based, text-mining tool that associates informative terms (iTerms) with genes based on text from PubMed abstracts
