# Highlights

In this study, we have mapped the transcriptional landscape of the various cell populations that compose human teeth at single-cell resolution, and we analyzed in deeper detail their stem cell populations and their microenvironment.

Concerning teeth, one recent article reported the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of mouse dental tissue and the human dental pulp, focusing mostly on the continuously growing mouse incisor and on the conservation between species of cellular populations and features that underlie tooth growth (Krivanek et al., 2020). A second single-cell RNA sequencing analysis study in the continuously erupting mouse incisor identified dental epithelial stem cells subpopulations that are important upon tooth injury and contribute to enamel regeneration (Sharir et al., 2019).

Odontoblasts were characterized by the expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) (Figure 1I) and dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1),

We obtained the periodontal tissue by scraping the surface of the apical two-thirds of the roots of five extracted third molars.

nexpectedly, the main dental pulp and periodontal MSC populations exhibited very similar molecular signatures.
\
Periodontal MSCs were also characterized by higher expression of SPARC/osteonectin, a secreted molecule fundamental for the regulation of periodontal homeostasis and collagen content

This is the first complete single-cell atlas of human teeth that allows a comparative single-cell RNA analysis of human dental pulp and periodontium
