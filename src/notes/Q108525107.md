# Highlights

. Gilda integrates machine-learned disambiguation models to choose between ambiguous strings given relevant surrounding text as context, and supports species-prioritization in case of ambiguity.

Here, we present Gilda, a software tool and web service which integrates multiple
biomedical lexical resources and implements a scored string matching algorithm (parts of
which were adapted from the text tagger in [4]) to names and synonyms across entries in
these resources. Importantly, Gilda makes available over 1,000 machine-learned
disambiguation models for strings representing multiple ambiguous entities, and can apply
these models as part of the scoring process given surrounding text as context. Gilda
achieves state of the art performance on several of the BioCreative VI NEN benchmarking
tasks and is competitive on the rest.

Each of the resources listed in Supplementary Table 1 are processed to extract a list of
terms, with each term carrying the following information, illustrated via the example of
”MEK1”: (i) Namespace (e.g., HGNC); (ii) Identifier within the namespace (e.g., 6840); (iii)
Text name (e.g, MEK1); (iv) Type of text name (e.g., synonym); (v) Canonicalized text
name (e.g., mek1); (vi) Standard name (e.g., MAP2K1); (vii) Source (e.g., hgnc).
To allow extensions and customizations, the Gilda Python package supports instantiation
with custom grounding resources, and is able to load terms from ontologies in OWL, OBO,
and other standard formats using the PyOBO1 package.
