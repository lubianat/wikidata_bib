# Highlights

The ciliary body critically contributes to the ocular physiology with multiple responsibilities in the production of aqueous humor, vision accommodation and intraocular immunity


Cell-type discriminative gene markers were also revealed. Unique gene expression patterns essential for ciliary epithelium-mediated aqueous humor inflow and ciliary smooth muscle contractility were identified

The ciliary epithelium is a bilayer cell alignment comprising the exterior pigmented epithelium (PE) layer and the interior non-pigmented epithelium (NPE) layer

Like the brain, the eye is one of the few immune privileged sites of the body. Due to the segregated state from the peripheral immune system, the eye contains various myeloid cells that respond to foreign and self-antigens, and locally, tissue-resident macrophages or microglia are the well-characterized immune cell types that mediate baseline immunity in the intraocular tissues [7–9]. Extensive studies from rodent eyes have revealed that the immune cell populations of the healthy ciliary body consist primarily of cells of the myeloid lineage such as monocytes and macrophages; however, comparatively little work has been focused on the immune environment of the human ciliary body [9].

 Taken together, our study provides a detailed molecular and cellular portrait of human ciliary body that has wide implications for the understanding of the cellular basis of intraocular fluid homeostasis and immune environment.

We then sorted the cells into 14 individual clusters, as visualized by UMAP, based on their gene expression profiles and annotated the clusters using known marker genes (Fig. 1A, ​A,BB and Suppl. Table 3

In agreement with a previous study [38] that compared the single-cell transcriptome between mouse PE and NPE, we also found that human NPE expressed higher levels of the ZIC family transcription factors ZIC1 and ZIC2 than PE (Fig. 2E). 

Taken together, our data demonstrated that there are no classic lymphatics in mammalian ciliary body at physiological baseline condition.



iliary body and the contiguous retina tissue [38], we found that most cell types, including the ciliary epithelium, SMC, vascular EC, fibroblast, melanocyte, Schwann cell, myeloid (macrophage and neutrophil) and lymphoid (T cell and B cell) cell populations, were present in both species, despite at varied frequencies
