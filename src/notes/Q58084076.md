# Highlights

s. To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, here we analysed 23,822 cells from two areas at distant poles of the mouse neocortex: the primary visual cortex and the anterior lateral motor cortex

Our study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct areas of the adult mouse cortex.

 We analysed 14,249 cells from the VISp and 9,573 cells from the ALM to define 133 transcriptomic types and establish correspondence between glutamatergic neuron projection patterns and their transcriptomic identities.    

 A clear hierarchy of transcriptomic cell types and their relationships emerged (Fig. 1). Consistent with previous reports19,20, the biggest differences are observed between non-neuronal (n = 1,383) and neuronal (n = 22,439) cells.

 This dichotomy correlates with neuronal connectivity patterns and developmental origins. Most glutamatergic types in VISp or ALM project to different cortical and subcortical targets (Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 10), whereas nearly all GABAergic interneurons form local connections. Most glutamatergic neurons are born locally within the ventricular–subventricular zone of the developing cortex4
