We classify these studies into two broad categories: (i) mining big data generated from acrowd (e.g. search logs) and (ii) active crowdsourcing via specific technical platforms, e.g. labor markets, wikis, scientificgames and community challenges. Through describing each study in detail, we demonstrate the applicability of differentmethods in a variety of domains in biomedical research, including genomics, biocuration and clinical research.

Megatasks  are  high  difficulty  tasks  that  are  often  ap-proached through open innovation contests [15] where the keychallenge is to find a few talented individuals from a large pool,e.g. challenging games such as Foldit [16]

Crowd data mining refers to the research activities of collectingand analyzing the data, produced by people through participa-tion  in  public  forums,  for  the  knowledge  discovery  process.


Ingram  et  al.  [26]  used  Google  Trends  (http://www.google.com/trends/), an online tool that gives statistics on search termusage  in  Google,  to  study  the  seasonal  phenomena  in  sleep-disordered  breathing  using  different  variations  of  the  searchterms such as ‘snoring’, ‘sleep apnea’, ‘snoring children’, ‘sleepapnea children’. 

A labor market platform provides the technical environment todesign and submit the crowdsourcing microtasks, and more im-portantly,  acts  as  the  human  labor  market  so  that  appropri-ate 2workers could be recruited for the submitted tasks. Someof  the  most  popular  platforms  include  Amazon  MechanicalTurk   (MTurk)   (https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)   andCrowdflower (http://www.crowdflower.com/). 

In the crowdsourced NLP domain, most of the recent studiesare focused on performing NER of drug or disease entities owingto  their  critical  roles  in  biomedical  research  [2,38].  Zhai  et  al.[39] used crowdsourcing for medication NER and entity linkagein eligibility criteria section of clinical trial announcement docu-ments

many  recent  studies  have  proposed  hybridapproaches combining text mining and crowdsourcing in curat-ing drug indications, gene–disease associations and biomedicalontologies [48–51]

Using  computer  games  as  a  crowdsourcing  approach  forsolving science problems is intriguing and promising, as it canpotentially  reach  a  large  and  diverse  player  population.  Also,once the game is properly developed, no additional incentivesare needed for recruiting participation, as it is inherent in gameplay.  However,  these  potential  benefits  are  commonly  associ-ated with high up-front costs and time in game development.Furthermore,  highly skillful game developers may not be easyto  find  among  typical  bioinformatics  researchers.  Finally,  thescientific  games  are  often  associated  with  large  number  ofregistered players but few active players.

Besides  the  studies  involving  labor  mar-kets,  all  surveyed  studies  offered  intrinsic  motivation  to  thecrowd [63], i.e. the task was worth doing for the task itself. Otherprominent  reasons  include  the  interest  of  people  in  trackingtheir  health information or looking up health  information on-line, interest in the broader field and interest in building reputa-tion in the scientific community through personal branding.
