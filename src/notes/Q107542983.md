# Highlights
Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models (GO-CAMs) assemble individual associations of gene products with cellular components, molecular functions and biological processes into causally linked activity flow models.

To convert the rich content of Reactome into GO-CAMs, we have developed a software tool, Pathways2GO, to convert the entire set of normal human Reactome pathways into GO-CAMs.

A GO annotation is an association between a single gene product and a single GO term.

The recently developed Gene Ontology Causal Activity Modeling (GO-CAM) framework defines a schema for linking together multiple annotations (as well as additional contextual information) into larger models of biological processes, including pathways (Thomas et al., 2019; see also http://geneontology.org/docs/gocam-overview/, http://geneontology.org/docs/sparql and https://github.com/geneontology/neo#readme)

--> from http://geneontology.org/docs/gocam-overview/,

. For example, a GO-CAM can represent how the activities of different gene products work together in a pathway or “biological program.” GO-CAM models can connect different pieces of information about the function of a gene product (joining together different annotations for the same gene product), and/or can connect functions of different gene products together by specifying how the activity of one gene product can affect the activity of another gene product. All connections in a GO-CAM model are made using clearly defined semantic relations from the Relations Ontology. Browse existing models on the GO-CAM public site.


The central element in GO-CAM is the molecular activity, an instance of a GO molecular function term; multiple activities are connected by causal relations into a data model (Fig. 1B) that is comparable in detail and organization to the activity flow (AF) SBGN visualization of a pathway (Le Novère et al., 2009).


The classes used to define gene products are drawn from NEO, the Noctua Entity Ontology (https://github.com/geneontology/neo#readme), which integrates identifiers for all of the gene products used in GO-CAMs into a single large OWL ontology, rooted under the ChEBI class ‘information biomacromolecule’ (CHEBI: 33695).

We made a pragmatic choice to take Reactome entities that do not map to existing GO-CAM ontologies, and represent them in a new ontology, REACTO, that defines a class for each of the unmapped entities in Reactome


The REACTO ontology includes features that correspond to those of the Protein Ontology (PRO) (Natale et al., 2017). PRO is a well-recognized community resource, and addition of PRO instance identifiers to Reactome proteoforms, complexes and sets and adaptation of Pathways2GO will simplify the generation of GO-CAMs from Reactome pathways and the extension of the conversion process to other pathway resources and to model organism pathways.
