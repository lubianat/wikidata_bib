# Highlights

We identified dozens of cell states, with thymic epithelial cells (TECs) showing the highest degree of heterogeneity. Our analysis highlights four major medullary TEC (mTEC I–IV) populations, with distinct molecular functions, epigenetic landscapes and lineage regulators

Index sorting analysis using the canonical cortical (Ly51) and medullary (UEA1) markers revealed that only one of the groups corresponds to the Ly51+UEA1− population and expresses cTEC-specific genes, including Prss16, Psmb11 and Ctsl2

Notably, mTEC IV cells were more similar to intestinal Hpgds-tdTomato+ tuft cells than to any of the TEC subpopulations (Fig. 4a).

Finally, deficiency of a master regulator of intestinal tuft cells, Pou2f3, resulted in the complete loss of the mTEC IV population without affecting the development of any other TEC population (Fig. 4f, g and Extended Data Fig. 8), suggesting that they represent a bona fide tuft cell population.

In summary, our study provides a comprehensive atlas of the stromal populations in the thymus of adult mice and during differentiation.
