# Highlights

Building on previous work (cf. Turki et al., 2022) that explored how COVID-19-related information can be collaboratively curated in a knowledge graph, the research presented here zooms in on how statistical information about pathogens, diseases and disease outbreaks can be validated using logical constraints.

Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/) just fits this need as a CC02 licensed, large-scale, multilingual knowledge graph used to represent human knowledge in a structured format (Resource Description Framework or RDF) (Vrandečić & Krötzsch, 2014; Turki et al., 2019). 

We implement these constraints with SPARQL and test them on Wikidata using the public SPARQL endpoint of this knowledge graph, available at https://query.wikidata.org. 

Currently, there is mostly an effort to normalize how to define SPARQL queries, particularly for knowledge graph validation purposes, to save runtime and ameliorate the completeness of the output of a query using a set of heuristics and axioms (Salas & Hogan, 2022).
