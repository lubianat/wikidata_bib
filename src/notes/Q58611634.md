# Highlights

The UniProt website has been augmented with new data visualizations for the subcellular localization of proteins as well as their structure and interactions. UniProt resources are available under a CC-BY (4.0) license via the web at https://www.uniprot.org/.

We continue to see exponential growth in many of our datasets, see Figure 1. We are managing this growth by a number of processes. Most critically, a redundancy removal process was first introduced in 2015. This process identifies and removes almost identical proteomes of the same species before their inclusion in UniProtKB (https://www.uniprot.org/help/proteome_redundancy) 

Programmatic access to the non-redundant proteomes included in UniProtKB is provided via the Proteins API (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/doc/) (7) whilst all proteomes reference, non-reference and redundant in UniProtKB and UniParc are accessible via the Proteome section of the UniProt website (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/).

Expert curation of the literature is critically important to the UniProt databases. The information extracted from scientific publications is stored in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot section of the UniProt Knowledgebase and describes functional information both in the form of human readable free-text/controlled syntax summaries and via structured vocabularies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) (15) or ChEBI (16). Expert curation is labour intensive, with curators assimilating and evaluating multiple lines of evidence from the text and figures of relevant publications, but this has repeatedly proven to be the most efficient method of extracting all relevant data from a paper.
We have previously demonstrated that UniProtKB expert biocuration captures between 35 and 45% of the curatable literature for any given species, rising to 50% of the curatable literature for Homo sapiens (17).

Once a record has been moved into UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot from UniProtKB/TrEMBL, there is a concerted effort to ensure that it is regularly updated to ensure the current understanding of a proteinâ€™s activity reflects that in the scientific literature.

In order to share our knowledge in computational annotation and our rule-based systems, we are working on developing standard formats for rule annotation and tools to apply them. UniFire (the UNIprot Functional annotation Inference Rule Engine) is a standalone tool to apply the UniProt annotation rules on third party data.
