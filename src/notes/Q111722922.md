# Highlights
Costal chondrocytes (CCs), as a promising donor cell source for cell-based therapy for cartilage repair, have strong tendency of hypertrophy and calcification, which limited CCs from further application in cartilage regenerative medicine. Synovium-derived stromal cells (SDSCs), have shown their beneficial effect for chondrocytes to maintain phenotype.
. Moreover, synovium-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (SDSCs), a cell subpopulation in synoviocytes, having a superior proliferation and chondrogenic potential compared with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from other tissue sources [[24], [25],

SD rats aged 3–4 months and weighing about 300 ​g were used as the source of CCs and SDSCs.
