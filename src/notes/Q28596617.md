DisGeNET-RDF: harnessing the innovative power of the Semantic Web to explore the genetic basis of diseases
==========================================================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q28596617]  

# Highlights

DisGeNET-RDF makes available knowledge on the genetic basis of human diseases in the Semantic Web. Gene-disease associations (GDAs) and their provenance metadata are pub- lished as human-readable and machine-processable web resources.

Availability and implementation: http://rdf.disgenet.org/ 

--> Link is nicely working. 

The DisGeNET ontology is integrated into the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (http://sio. semanticscience.org) (SIO) (Dumontier et al., 2014) that provides ontology support for Bio2RDF Linked Data among other projects.

--> I did not know about semantic science.


ur RDF dataset is interlinked to Linked Open Data (LOD) implementations of bio- medical databases and several disease terminologies such as MeSH, OMIM, Orphanet or ICD9-CM available through Linked Data projects such as Bio2RDF (see statistics at Datahub (http:// datahub.io/ca/dataset/disgenet)). Consequently, DisGeNET appears in the LOD cloud diagram

--> Cool
