# Highlights
The query language is SPARQL extended by two QLever-specic predicates ql:contains-entity and ql:contains-word,
which can express the occurrence of an entity or word (the object of
the predicate) in a text record (the subject of the predicate).

We compare against three state-of-theart query engines for knowledge bases with varying support for text
search: RDF-3X, Virtuoso, Broccoli. ery times are competitive
and oen faster on the pure SPARQL queries, and several orders of
magnitude faster on the SPARQL+Text queries.

or Virtuoso (described in Section 2), this is realized via a special predicate
bif:contains, where the bif prex stands for built-in function. For
example, the following query searches for astronauts who have
wrien a book with the words rst and moon in the title:
SELECT ?x ?y WHERE {
?x <is-a> <Astronaut> .
?x <books-wrien> ?w .
?w bif:contains “rst AND moon”
}

We assume that the text is given as a separate corpus, and
that named entity recognition and disambiguation (of the entities
from the knowledge base in the text) has been performed.

SELECT ?x TEXT(?t) WHERE {
?x <is-a> <Astronaut> .
?t ql:contains-entity ?x .
?t ql:contains-word ”walk moon”
} ORDER BY DESC(SCORE(?t)) TEXTLIMIT 1 LIMIT 16

is query nds astronauts that have a mention in a text record that
also contains the words walk and moon (note that, for the sake of
brevity, ql:contains-word does not require an AND like bif:contains).
For our evaluation and all our examples in this paper, the text
records are sentences.2


e. e same approach is used by other SPARQL engines with support for keyword search, for example, in Jena (see
hp://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/text-query.html). As
explained in Section 1, this does not support entity occurrences
anywhere in the text like QLever’s ql:contains-entity predicate does
