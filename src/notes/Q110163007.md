Few-shot link prediction via graph neural networks for Covid-19 drug-repurposing
==========
  
  [@wikidata:Q110163007]  
  

# Highlights
 Furthermore,
we apply our method on the drug-repurposing
knowledge graph (DRKG) for discovering drugs
for Covid-19. We pose the drug discovery task
as link prediction and learn embeddings for the
biological entities that partake in the DRKG

Towards assisting such machine learning techniques (Ioannidis et al.,
2020) created a comprehensive biological knowledge graph
relating genes, compounds, diseases, biological processes,
side effects and symptoms termed Drug Repurposing
Knowledge Graph (DRKG).
