# Highlights
To address these problems, we present here an approach to use nanopublications and a decentralized network of services to allow users to directly publish small Linked Data statements through a simple and user-friendly interface, called Nanobench, powered by semantic templates that are themselves published as nanopublications.

We also show that Nanobench makes it indeed very easy for users to publish Linked Data statements, even for those who have no prior experience in Linked Data publishing.

Linked Data publishing is therefore mostly done by large centralized entities such as DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007) and Wikidata (Vrandečić & Krötzsch, 2014).

We have previously argued that these Linked Data representations should ideally come directly from the authors (i.e., the researchers), should cover not just metadata properties but the content of the scientific findings themselves, and should become the main publication object instead of papers with narrative text, in what we called genuine semantic publishing (Kuhn & Dumontier, 2017)

A further noteworthy technology is the Linked Data Platform (LDP) (Speicher, Arwe & Malhotra, 2015) to manage and provide Linked Data. In order to establish connections between producers and consumers of Linked Data, subscription and notification protocols such as WebSub (https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) and provenance pingbacks (https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-aq/#provenance-pingback) have been proposed.

Just like with TPF, intelligent clients can be built that can handle more complex queries (such as SPARQL queries) over QPF APIs.

Nanopublications can be reliably and redundantly published by uploading them to the existing nanopublication server network (Kuhn et al., 2016),

To demonstrate and evaluate our approach, we next implemented a client application that runs on the user’s local computer, can be accessed through their web browser, and connects to the above decentralized network of services. The code can be found online (https://github.com/peta-pico/nanobench) and Fig. 3 shows a screenshot.
