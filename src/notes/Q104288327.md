# Highlights
FLiCRE enables fast light- and calcium-gated molecular labeling of active neurons
â€¢
Combining FLiCRE with optogenetic tagging identifies functionally coupled circuits

 Here, we report a molecular technology for stable genetic tagging of cells that exhibit activity-related increases in intracellular calcium concentration (FLiCRE). We used FLiCRE to transcriptionally label activated neural ensembles in the nucleus accumbens of the mouse brain during brief stimulation of aversive inputs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we detected FLiCRE transcripts among the endogenous transcriptome, providing simultaneous readout of both cell-type and calcium activation history.
 
  We identified a cell type in the nucleus accumbens activated downstream of long-range excitatory projections. 

To label the downstream neurons in NAc activated by excitatory glutamatergic inputs, we injected FLiCRE and implanted an optical fiber in the NAc of the Thy1::ChR2 mice. In these mice, ChR2 is expressed in excitatory layer 5 neurons in the frontal cortex (and in the hippocampus and amygdala) 

These clusters were similarly represented across the three experimental replicates (Figures S4A and S4B), and they were also detected in samples from wild-type uninjected mice, importantly showing that the expression of FLiCRE AAVs did not grossly alter the transcriptome-based classification of cell types in the brain (Figures S4C and S4D).

Our behavioral findings, along with our sequencing results highlighting the heterogeneous transcriptional profile among different D1 MSN subtypes, suggest that finer granularity is required to define the functional neuronal subtypes in NAc.
