# Highlights

o address this, we developed a 3D-printed, low-cost droplet microfluidic control instrument and deploy it in a clinical environment to perform single-cell transcriptome profiling of disaggregated synovial tissue from five rheumatoid arthritis patients. We sequence 20,387 single cells revealing 13 transcriptomically distinct clusters.

The total cost of materials to construct an instrument is approximately $575. This represents an approximately 20-fold and 200-fold reduction in cost compared to a research-level, syringe-pump based microfluidic setup, and a commercial microfluidic platform, respectively.

The instrument is fully open-source and instructions for its use and construction have been deposited in the open fluidics repository Metafluidics37 (https://metafluidics.org/devices/minidrops/)

Unsupervised taxonomy of cellular states in synovial tissue

We identified six lymphocyte subpopulations corresponding to heterogeneous groups of T, B, and NK cells. T cells (CD3+) were grouped into CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (cytotoxic) subpopulations based on canonical markers.
