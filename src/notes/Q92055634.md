Four cellular states drive glioblastoma malignant cells heterogeneity

 The relative frequency of cells in each state varies between glioblastoma samples and is influenced by copy number amplifications of the CDK4, EGFR, and PDGFRA loci and by mutations in the NF1 locus, which each favor a defined state. Our work provides a blueprint for glioblastoma, integrating the malignant cell programs, their plasticity, and their modulation by genetic drivers.Four cellular states drive glioblastoma malignant cells heterogeneity

Studies of inter-tumor heterogeneity based on bulk expression profiles suggest that at least three subtypes of glioblastoma exist, namely proneural (TCGA-PN), classical (TCGA-CL), and mesenchymal (TCGA-MES) (Verhaak et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2017).

To focus on malignant cells, we sorted cells by both viability marker and by the pan-immune marker CD45, and we profiled primarily CD45− cells and only to a more limited extent CD45+ cells

To comprehensively characterize intra-tumoral heterogeneity among the malignant cells, we identified expression programs that vary between cells within each tumor and then sought the recurrent programs (“meta-modules”) that were identified across different tumors (Filbin et al., 2018, Tirosh et al., 2016a, Tirosh et al., 2016b, Venteicher et al., 2017).

or example, we searched for differentially expressed genes between the tumors with high frequency of AC-like cells (AC-high tumors) and those with low frequency of AC-like cells (AC-low) within our 28-tumor cohort. To control for differences in the proportions of states between those cohorts, we separately compared cells in each of the four states (Figure S5D).

We find that malignant cells in glioblastoma exist in a limited set of cellular states that recapitulate (1) neural-progenitor-like (NPC-like), (2) oligodendrocyte-progenitor-like (OPC-like), (3) astrocyte-like (AC-like), and (4) mesenchymal-like (MES-like) states.
