scMontage: Fast and Robust Gene Expression Similarity Search for Massive Single-cell Data
=========================================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q104552207]  

# Highlights

Renovated gene expression similarity search server, which is developed for analyzing massive-scale scRNA-seq data, based on the SHOGoiN human cell type database.

After selecting the database by specifying the organism and the platform, the user can limit the genes for calculation to particular types according to Gene Ontology.

The scMontage basically runs on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient as a similarity metric of gene  expression profiles.

The scMontage server currently provides 5,035 single-cell transcriptome data (1,424 human and 3,611 mouse cell samples on 23 August 2018) whose cell types are available by original submitters.
