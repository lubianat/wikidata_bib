# Highlights

A transcriptome-wide subcellular RNA atlas was generated by proximity labeling

We uncover a radial organization of the nuclear transcriptome, which is gated at the inner surface of the nuclear pore for cytoplasmic export of processed transcripts.

The two demonstrations—on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ERM) in yeast and mammalian cells (Jan et al., 2014), and on the OMM in yeast (Williams et al., 2014)—showed high spatial specificity and compatibility with living cells.
