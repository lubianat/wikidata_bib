# Highlights
. This proposal describes what a team would need to distribute public health information in Wikipedia in multiple languages in response to a disaster or crisis, and to measure and report the communication impact of the same. 

Most of the text here is from the original proposal, but there are modifications to remove the names of the funder, named partners, and for other details to make this text more reusable. The budget in this proposal has been converted from a dollar amount to equivalent descriptions in terms of labor hours, and the timeline was adapted from absolute to relative months.

Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b show sample data visualizations in Wikipedia that support making editorial decisions for Wikipedia by mirroring expert consensus. We are part of the community that curates such analyses.
