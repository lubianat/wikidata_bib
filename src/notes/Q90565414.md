# Highlights

We generated a single-cell atlas of pulmonaryfibrosis. Using this atlas, we demonstrated heterogeneity withinalveolar macrophages and epithelial cells from subjects withpulmonaryfibrosis. These results support the feasibility ofdiscovery-based approaches using next-generation sequencingtechnologies to identify signaling pathways for targeting inthe development of personalized therapies for patients withpulmonaryfibrosis

We identified rarecell populations including airway stem cellsand senescent cells emerging duringpulmonaryfibrosis

Single-cell RNA-Seq was performed oneight donor lung biopsies and eight lungexplants from patients with pulmonaryfibrosis attributed to IPF (four patients),systemic sclerosis (two patients),polymyositis (one patient), and chronichypersensitivity pneumonitis (one patient)

Inthe human lung, we identified alveolar typeII cells; alveolar type I cells; ciliated, club,and basal airway epithelial cells; alveolarmacrophages; dendritic cells; T cells andnatural killer T cells; plasma cells andB cells;fibroblasts; and endothelial andlymphatic cells (Figure 1A;seeTable E1).Each cluster included cells from donorsand patients with pulmonaryfibrosis(Figure 1B). In the mouse, we were able toidentify all cell types seen in the humanlung and several rare and difficult to isolatecell populations, including additionalendothelial and lymphatic cell populations;megakaryocytes; innate lymphoid cells;and mesothelial cells (seeFigure E2B andTable E2).

n conclusion, single-cell RNAsequencing of normal andfibrotic lungtissue reveals shared and distinct patterns offibrotic gene expression in individual cellpopulations and emphasizes the importanceof intracellular communication in diseasepathobiology.
