# Highlights

The Protein Data Bank (PDB) (wwPDB consortium, 2019[wwPDB consortium (2019). Nucleic Acids Res. 47, D520-D528.]) is the single global archive of experimentally determined three-dimensional (3D) structure data of biological macromolecules
The PDBx/mmCIF dictionary and format are machine-readable and fully extensible; they assure that the wwPDB partners can effectively represent, biocurate, validate and distribute structural biology data. The data dictionary is regularly updated to reflect evolution of the underlying science and technology. The current version of the dictionary (5.303), which includes >4300 data items, is organized as 553 interlinked categories, clustered into 41 groups that describe atomic coordinates, polymer and small-molecule chemistry, details of sample production, experimental setup, data collection and processing, and cross-references to other biological databases

o ensure consistency, more than 25% of the data items are subject to controlled vocabularies, which are periodically updated 

The legacy PDB format (based on the Hollerith IBM 80-column punched-card format) was first introduced by the PDB in 1970s (Protein Data Bank, 1971[Protein Data Bank (1971). Nature New Biol. 233, 223.]), wherein `ATOM' records included atom and residue names and sequence numbers, and the `HEADER' record contained a limited amount of metadata (https://wwpdb.org/documentation/file-format)
