# Highlights

By applying a
generalizable analysis scheme, we deﬁne a precise temporal order of early viral gene
expression and propose a set-wise emergence of viral genes. We identify host cell genes and
pathways relevant for infection by combining three different computational approaches: gene
and pathway overdispersion analysis, prediction of cell-state transition probabilities, as well
as future cell states.

scRNA-seq of HSV-1-infected primary ﬁbroblasts.

Stepwise progression of viral gene expression. Within lytic
infection, viral genes have been classiﬁed as immediate early (α),
early (β), and late (γ, γ1, γ2) 1,27 . Since the temporal order of
genes expressed from the virus genome is intrinsically encoded in
their single-cell expression proﬁles, we developed an approach to
reﬁne the viral gene expression cascade.

To include viral genes that are transcribed later, we analyzed
cells harvested at 5 hpi the same way as the 1/3 hpi cells in Fig. 2c,
d (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c). Again, the clustering revealed a set-
wise emergence of viral genes, that is, sets of genes being
transcribed together.

RNA velocity shows transcription bursts and cell cycle arrest.
To infer expression dynamics in individual cells, we used RNA
velocity 38.
