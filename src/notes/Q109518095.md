# Highlights
Semantic web is an extension of the existing web where information is
given precise meaning allowing better collaboration between computers and
their users.

Wikidata actually fits the trends of information
technology development that extend the boundary from machine readable
to machine comprehensible data on the web.

The collaboration of Wikimedia Serbia10 with the University of Belgrade is a longstanding one (StakiÂ´c 2009). 

For a number of years now, students at the Faculty of Mining and Geology have been undergoing
training to enter data into and use the Wikidata
