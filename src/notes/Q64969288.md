# Highlights

. The ProteomeXchange (PX) consortium implements a mode of centralized metadata and distributed raw data management, which promotes effective data sharing. To facilitate open access of proteome data worldwide, we have developed the integrated proteome resource iProX (http://www.iprox.org) as a public platform for collecting and sharing raw data, analysis results and metadata obtained from proteomics experiments.

 iProX is based on a high availability architecture and has been deployed as part of the proteomics infrastructure of China, ensuring long-term and stable resource support. iProX will facilitate worldwide data analysis and sharing of proteomics experiments.

iProX is a public platform for collecting and sharing raw data, identifications and standardized metadata obtained from proteomics experiments.
