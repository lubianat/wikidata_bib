# Highlights

Knowledge-based biomedical data science (KBDS) involves the design and implementation of
computer systems that act as if they knew about biomedicine.1 There are many ways in which a
system might act as if it knew something: For example, it might use existing knowledge to generate,
rank, or evaluate hypotheses about a dataset, or it might answer a natural language question about
a biomedical topic.

Within the biomedical domain, ontologies [e.g., the Gene Ontology (GO) (3)] are community
consensus views of the entities involved in biology, medicine, and biomedical research, analogous
to how nomenclature committees systematize naming conventions. 

Many challenges to designing, constructing, and utilizing KGs within the biomedical domain have
been identified. Some of the more difficult challenges include (a) computational performance,
(b) constructing KGs using expert curation or information extraction methods, and (c) meaningfully integrating disparate data sources. Each of these challenges is discussed further below.

GO-CAMs have great promise, but currently only
a relatively small number have been curated (17). Reactome (18) provides a very high quality and
extensive KG grounded in community-curated ontologies, but it is limited in scope to biochemical
reactions and pathways.

One of the reviewed papers
that provided both types of evaluation utilized crowdsourcing as a means to validate triples from
their KG (95).
