# Highlights
BioLiP (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/BioLiP/) is a semi-manually curated database for biologically relevant ligand–protein interactions. 

The BioLiP database is updated weekly and the current release contains 204 223 entries.

Binding MOAD excludes small DNA/RNA molecules and metal ions, which are in fact important ligand molecules in many proteins (8,9). PDBbind (4) is another ligand-binding affinity database that has less strict requirements than Binding MOAD (e.g. lower structure resolution, inclusion of DNA/RNA molecules and peptides). BindingDB (6) is a database that collects binding data directly from scientific literatures. 

In this article, we aim to construct a comprehensive database of biologically relevant ligand–protein interactions collected from the PDB.
