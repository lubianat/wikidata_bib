# Highlights

The terms “type B synoviocytes,” “fibroblast-like
synoviocytes (FLS),” “synovium-derived mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs),” and “synovial fibroblasts (SF)”
appeared in different articles related to human
synovial-derived cells in various disease models, yet
they seemed to be describing the same cell type.
However, to date, there is no clear standard to
distinguish these terms; thus, the hypothesis that they
represent the same cell type is currently inconclusive.
Therefore, this review aims to clarify the similarities
and differences between these terms and to diffuse
the chaotic nomenclature of synovial-derived cells.


Initially, we named this group of
cells as “articular synoviocytes” because these cells were
derived from the joint cavity [1]. Then, we found that
Barland [2] and Ghadially [3] divided the synovial in-
timal cells into two cell types via electron microscopy:
type A cells and type B cells; thus, we renamed our cells
as “type B synoviocytes” to reflect their phenotype more
accurately [4
