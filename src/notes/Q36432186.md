SemMedDB: a PubMed-scale repository of biomedical semantic predications
=======================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q36432186]  

# Highlights

We describe SemMedDB, a repository of semantic predications (subject–predi- cate–object triples) extracted from the entire set of PubMed citations

available as a MySQL database

SemRep extracts the predica- tion Infection-CAUSES-Guillain-Barre Syndrome from the sen- tence Infections can trigger GBS. By normalizing the free text describing a relation to UMLS domain knowledge, SemRep provides the ability to combine and link knowledge from various sources as well as aggregate knowledge at PubMed.

12.9M Unique predications

We are currently combining predications with microarray data to automatically generate gene regulatory networks.

SemMedDB has formed the basis of several clinical applica-
tions. Jonnalagadda et al. (2012) generate therapy-oriented sum- maries to support clinical decision making, while Liu et al. (2012) elucidate the association between medical concepts co-occurring in clinical reports.
