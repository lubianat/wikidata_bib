# Highlights

Spatial Molecular Imaging platform (CosMxTM SMI, NanoString Technologies, Seattle,
WA) utilizes high-plex in-situ imaging chemistry for both RNA and protein detection. This
automated instrument provides 1000â€™s of plex, at high sensitivity (1 to 2 copies/cell), very low
error rate (0.0092 false calls/cell) and background (~0.04 counts/cell). T

1. Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) Chemistry and Workflow
SMI is developed to perform multiple cycles of the nucleic-acid hybridization of
fluorescent molecular barcodes to enable in-situ measurement of RNAs and proteins on intact
biological samples at subcellular resolution. The SMI chemistry is an enzyme-free, nucleic acid
amplification-free, hybridization-based single-molecule barcode sequencing methodology, which
can be directly applied to intact FFPE and fresh-frozen tissues on 1 mm-thick standard glass slides
for pathology.
