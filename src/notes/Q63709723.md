A suite of independent Python packages for downloading, parsing, warehousing, and converting multi-modal and
multi-scale biological databases to Biological Expression Language.

OmniPath (​ Türei ​ et al ​ ., 2016) began to address these facets when it combined several signaling pathway and
transcriptional regulation databases. It achieved interoperability between several databases by normalizing the
identifiers and relationships between entities from several databases describing the same phenomena (e.g.,
microRNA-target interactions, protein-protein interactions, etc.) and creating a unified network.

With the same focus on reproducibility as Bio2RDF, OmniPath, and Pathway Commons as well as deference to
software maintainability and the ease of development and inclusion of new biological data sources, we have
developed a growing list of ​ Bio2BEL packages, each capable of downloading, structuring, and serializing various
biological data sources to BEL (​ Table 2 ​ ).

Because all Bio2BEL packages are uniform in their implementation and CLI usage, it is trivial to provide a
Dockerfile and Docker-Compose configuration for quick deployments. In the future, we plan to automatically
generate RESTful APIs, which may be more useful to deploy internally than to use publicly available ones due to
constraints like rate-limits. Because all Bio2BEL packages are independent, they avoid two major problems of
monolithic codebases: they are more robust to breakages or failures in a single package and they can be installed as
needed, which is pertinent as the data sources become larger, more heterogeneous, and more complex.

We developed BioKEEN as an extension to the previously developed NRL package, PyKEEN, to enable it to
directly acquire and preprocess BEL knowledge graphs, namely those generated by Bio2BEL (Ali ​ et al . ​ , 2018).
