# Highlights

We present McPAS-TCR, a manually curated database of TCR sequences associated with various pathologies and antigens based on published literature

  Moreover, specific pathology-related TCR sequences were detected across different individuals with the same pathology (Madi et al., 2014; Mamedov et al., 2011; Turner et al., 2006; Venturi et al., 2008). These findings indicate that TCR bias exists in pathological situations (Miles et al., 2010; Serana et al., 2009; Turner et al., 2006; Venturi et al., 2008), and the significance of this concept can be studied through the association of experimentally observed expanded TCR sequences with their respective pathologic conditions and antigens.

Nomenclature follows the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (http://www.imgt.org) (Lefranc et al., 1999). When a study used a different gene ontology system, it was converted to the IMGT nomenclature.

We searched the database for sequences that are related to leukemia. In the ‘Search database’ window, we typed ‘leukemia’ inside the query field above the ‘Pathology’ column. This gives three terms in the pop-up list: ‘Leukemia’, ‘Acute myeloid leukemia’ and ‘Murine leukemia virus (MuLV)’, which were all checked.
