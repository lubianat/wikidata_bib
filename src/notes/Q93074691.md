# Highlights

The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a standardized set of phenotypic terms that are organized in a hierarchical fashion. It is a widely used resource for capturing human disease phenotypes for computational analysis to support differential diagnostics.

The computational analysis can be coupled with the analysis of whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing data through applications such as Exomiser. This article explains how to choose an optimal set of HPO terms for these cases and enter them with software, such as PhenoTips and PatientArchive, and demonstrates how to use Phenomizer and Exomiser to generate a computational differential diagnosis.

We have been developing the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO, http://www.human-
phenotype-ontology.org) since 2008 to support differential diagnosis and translational
research within the field of rare genetic diseases (Robinson et al., 2008).

The HPO annotations (HPOAs) are disease descriptions that use these standard terms. The rare genetic disease Marfan syndrome, for instance, is characterized by and therefore annotated to
over 50 phenotypic abnormalities, including aortic aneurysm.
