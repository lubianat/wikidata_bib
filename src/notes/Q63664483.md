# Highlights

Deposited data often remain difficult to access as it requires significant pre-processing to become useful for regular analysis.

Our database provides a manually curated list of cell-type markers that can be incorporated into novel algorithms for inference of cell types.

The database of cell type markers was compiled by manual curation of thousands of published articles and abstracts, and by querying internet search engines with strings such as ‘GENE1 is expressed in ∗ cells’.

The cell-type identity is then determined using the collection of cell-type marker genes. Some marker genes are found in multiple cell types and are less informative for cell-type inference.

In such cases it is possible to compare if the predicted cell type matches the ‘biological’ cell type. We identified 17 independent datasets with homogeneous cell-type populations, where the biological cell type has been reported.

At the time when this work was initiated, there was no published database or comprehensive list of genes that can be used for automatic cell-type assignment (CellMarker came out when this manuscript was in preparation).
