# Highlights

 Here we identify and describe the biology of distinct subsets of
fibroblasts responsible for mediating either inflammation or tissue damage in arthritis. We show
that deletion of FAPα+ fibroblasts suppressed both inflammation and bone erosions in murine
models of resolving and persistent arthritis.

Single cell transcriptional analysis identified two
distinct fibroblast subsets within the FAPα+ population: FAPα+ THY1+ immune effector
fibroblasts located in the synovial sub-lining, and FAPα+ THY1-
 destructive fibroblasts restricted
to the synovial lining layer. When adoptively transferred into the joint, FAPα+ THY1-
 fibroblasts
selectively mediate bone and cartilage damage with little effect on inflammation, whereas transfer
of FAPα+ THY1+ fibroblasts resulted in a more severe and persistent inflammatory arthritis, with
minimal effect on bone and cartilage

To determine the functional role of FAPα+ fibroblasts in vivo we selectively deleted FAPα+
cells during arthritis (extended data 1k-m). 

In summary, we have identified and described the pathological significance of fibroblast
heterogeneity in RA, an IMID in which inflammation and damage play key pathogenic
roles.
