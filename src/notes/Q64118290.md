Mapping the transcriptional diversity of genetically and anatomically defined cell populations in the mouse brain
=================================================================================================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q64118290]  

# Highlights

Cells from micro-dissected brain regions may contain more than one atomic cell type, we refer to these as genetically- and anatomically-identified cell populations (GACPs).

--> "atomic cell type", does this concept even make sense?

Pan-neuronal genes (genes expressed commonly in all neuronal populations but expressed at lower levels or not at all in non-neuronal cell populations.

Gene families to provide information about cell identities which  is not captured by ’gene-wise’ metrics like mean DEF, or by enrichment analysis.

This suggests that, similar to other tissues homeobox TFs play an important role in specifying cell types in the brain.

Alternative splicing: most branch point choices are made consistently, in an all-or-none fashion, for any given cell population

We assume that cell types are organized hierarchically in a tree-like fashion proceeding from major branches (e.g. ’cortical excitatory neuron’) to more specialized subtypes, with the terminal ’leaf-level’ branches comprising ’atomic’ cell types. Profiled cell populations are defined operationally by the intersection of a transgenic mouse strain (or in some cases anatomical projection target) and a brain region.

# Comments

"atomic cell type", does this concept even make sense?

Treats groups not as cell types, but as genetically- and anatomically-identified cell populations (GACPs).

Explicit assumption of hierarchy and atomic cell types!
