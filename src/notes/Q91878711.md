# Highlights

Existing normative flow cytometry data have several limitations including small sample sizes, incompletely described study populations, variable flow cytometry methodology, and limited depth for defining lymphocyte subpopulations. To overcome these issues, we defined high-dimensional flow cytometry reference ranges for the healthy human immune system using Human Immunology Project Consortium methodologies after carefully screening 127 subjects deemed healthy through clinical and laboratory testing. 

eference values for basic lymphocyte subsets, which provide a significant resource for clinical decisions and interpretation of immunological research in general, have been published in multiple populations throughout the world [1â€“8]. Existing normative data has several limitations including small sample sizes, incompletely described sample populations and flow cytometry techniques, and often limited depth regarding the immune cell populations described

To overcome these limitations and drive the field forward, leaders of the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) proposed standardized methods for immunophenotyping starting with flow cytometry [9]. In addition to improving the quality of flow cytometry in clinical trials and other immune system investigations, the long-term lofty goal of HIPC is to define the human immune system in health and disease, something only possible with rigorous standardization of flow cytometry methods [10]. HIPC proposed standardization in sample handling, reagents, instrument setup and data analysis. A central recommendation was a highly standardized 8-color flow cytometry assay for the identification of T cell, regulatory T cell (Treg), B cell, and innate cell (dendritic, natural killer [NK], and monocyte cells) subsets. Reference ranges for flow cytometry assays performed using these standards have not been published.

Researchers have the ability to select reference ranges for flow cytometry panels of interest by age, gender, and race filters. This tool will calculate summary statistics on the selected population and the data may be downloaded for study. 

The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry recommends a sample size of at least n = 120 for determination of laboratory reference values (International Federation of Clinical Chemistry. 1987, J Clinical Chemistry & Clinical Biochemistry)

The purpose of this study was to provide the human immunology community with a freely available resource for lymphocyte reference ranges, including novel reference ranges for certain immune subsets established using highly standardized and transparent methodologies from a rigorously described healthy human population.
