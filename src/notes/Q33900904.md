# Highlights
Aims: To report the recent yoga-related publications in the western healthcare context with particular interest in the subject and type of yoga titles.
Results: The number of yoga-related titles included in the PubMed database is limited until a marked increase 2000 and steady surge since 2007. Bibliometric analysis indicates that more than 200 new titles are added per annum since 201

Conclusions: The prevalence of yoga research in western healthcare is increasing. The marked increase in volume indicates the need for more systematic analysis of the literature in terms of quality and results.


With origins in 5,000 B.C.E. India, yoga combines specific postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditative techniques (dhyana), chants (mantras), and wisdom teachings (sutras) to encourage health and relaxation


The total number of yoga-related articles listed on the PubMed database from 1950 to 2012 is 2,099. Of these titles, 498 (24%) include 'yoga trials' and 324 (15%) 'Systematic Reviews' 

This bibliometric analysis employs a gross method to observe the annual trends of yoga citations in one medical database. The 'Systematic Reviews' and 'Trial' abstracts are not assessed for content validity. As the results of yoga and health conditions are not investigated, no conclusions in terms of the direction of correlation can be drawn from this study.
