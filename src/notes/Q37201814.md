# Highlights

A rigorous community- based assessment of the utility of SNP data for predicting anti-TNF treatment efficacy in RA patients was performed in the context of a DREAM Challenge (http://www.synapse.org/RA_ Challenge). An open challenge framework enabled the comparative evaluation of predictions developed by 73 research groups.

tudy design and challenge parameters. This study was
performed as an open analytical challenge using the DREAM framework11â€“14 (DREAM Challenges website; www.dreamchallenges. org) as a mechanism to test predictions developed across a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies

participants were provided with SNP data collected on 2,706 anti-TNF-treated RA patients6 (Supplementary Table 1) with which to develop predictive models
