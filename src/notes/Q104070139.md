# Highlights
ncRNA variants as novel biomarkers and targets for human diseases are largely unexplored.
Here we present ncRNAVar (http://www.liwzlab.cn/ncrnavar/), the first database that provides association data between validated ncRNA variants and human diseases through manual curation on 2650 publications and computational annotation.

The disease phenotypes were majorly classified and described by the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO).25 ncRNAVar provides user-friendly web interfaces and web services to allow users to search and browse the association data, as well as to download and submit new associations for future integration.

As far as we are aware, ncRNAVar is the first database that provides manually curated associations between human disease phenotypes and a broad range of ncRNA variants.

 In addition, we retrieved other ontology terms for disease phenotypes, which EFO does not cover, from Human Disease Ontology47 and NCI Thesaurus OBO Edition.48 In some cases, ncRNA variants associate with several molecular subtypes of a disease.
