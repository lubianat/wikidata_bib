# Highlights

 Single Cell Interactive Application (SCiAp) provides easy access to data from the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) and EMBL-EBI’s Single Cell Expression Atlas (SCEA)2 projects and can be deployed on different computing platforms, making single-cell data analysis of large-scale projects accessible to the scientific community.


he Galaxy framework has enabled flexible and scalable deployment across multiple clouds through the Galaxy–Kubernetes integration3, thereby supporting analysis of large datasets. Galaxy offers a user-friendly framework for building and sharing workflows. It

instance, known as the HCA Galaxy instance, is available at https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/ (Fig. 1).


For example, we produced more than 20 modules for Scanpy5, covering data input, filtering, normalization, variable genes, clustering, dimensionality reductions and trajectory methods, among others. 

SCiAp provides functionality from Scanpy, Seurat6, Monocle37, SC38, SCmap9, Scater10, SCCAF11, SCPred12, SCEasy and UCSC CellBrowser.
