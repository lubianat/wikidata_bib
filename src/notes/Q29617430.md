# Highlights

Here we use single-cell RNAsequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mousebone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysacchar-ide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal vari-ation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, whichwe validate by RNA-fluorescencein situhybridization for selecttranscripts.

In particular, hundreds of key immune genes arebimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes thatare very highly expressed at the population average.

Using SMART-Seq9,weconstructed complementary DNA libraries from 18 single BMDCs(S1â€“S18)

 a, RNA-Seq readdensities in single cells (blue) and population replicates (grey) for twoillustrative loci, each with two different isoforms (bottom)

Comparing our results to other single-cell RNA-Seq data sets (forexample, Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 4) indicates that the source ofthe analysed tissue (in vitroversusex vivo), the biological condition ofthe individual cells (steady state versus dynamically responding), andthe cellular microenvironment all probably influence the extent ofsingle-cell heterogeneity within a system

Figure 4|Analysis of co-variation in single-cell mRNA expression levelsreveals distinct maturity states and an antiviral cell circuit.


Future studies that cou-ple technological advances in experimental preparation with new com-putational approaches would enable analyses, based on hundreds orthousands of single cells, to reconstruct intracellular circuits, enumer-ate and redefine cell states and types, and transform our understandingof cellular decision-making on a genomic scale.
