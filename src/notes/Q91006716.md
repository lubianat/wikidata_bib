# Highlights

 The current release of ENdb documents 737 experimentally validated enhancers and their related information, including 384 target genes, 263 TFs, 110 diseases and 153 functions in human and mouse. Moreover, the enhancer-related information was supported by experimental evidences, such as RNAi, in vitro knockdown, western blotting, qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assay, chromatin conformation capture (3C) and chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) assays. ENdb provides a user-friendly interface to query, browse and visualize the detailed information of enhancers. The database is available at http://www.licpathway.net/ENdb.

Active enhancers are always marked by chromatin marks (e.g. H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) and can be identified through high-throughput and low-throughput experimental methods (4â€“8). The most commonly used low-throughput methods include RNAi (9), in vitro knockdown (10), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (11), western blotting (12), qRT-PCR (13), luciferase reporter assays (14), chromatin conformation capture (3C) (15) and chromosome conformation capture-on-chip (4C) (16) assays.


Here, we established a comprehensive, manually curated enhancer database for human and mouse (ENdb, http://www.licpathway.net/ENdb)

However, most of those databases focus on enhancers identified by high-throughput experimental techniques, while low-throughput techniques (e.g. RNAi, EMSA, western blotting, qRT-PCR, luciferase reporter assay, 3C and 4C) are more accurate in identifying enhancers and in exploring their upstream/downstream regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we developed ENdb, a comprehensive database of all enhancers that were validated by low-throughput experiments in human and mouse.

 We will also consider continuously adding experimentally-supported enhancers from different species. We believe that ENdb can serve as a reliable and valuable resource of enhancers information to understand human diseases and biological processes.
