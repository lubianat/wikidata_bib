# Highlights

However, for many research groups, building their own biomedical KG is prohibitively expensive. This motivated us to build the BioCypher framework to support users in creating KGs (https://biocypher.org).

Even for similar tasks, the KG structure or subtle decisions about included resources lead to different results for many modern analytic methods2. In addition, decisions about how to represent knowledge at each primary resource pose problems in their integration â€” for instance, via the use of different identifier namespaces, levels of granularity or licenses.

Input adapters allow delegating maintenance work to one central place for each resource, ontology adapters give access to the wealth of structured information curated by the ontology community, and output adapters allow benchmarking and selection of database management systems

To inform the contents of this meta-graph, we have reactivated and now maintain the Biomedical Resource Ontology8, which helps to categorize pipelines and adapters into research areas, data types and purposes (Supplementary Note 2).  

We believe that creating a more interoperable biomedical research community is as much a social effort as it is a scientific software problem. To facilitate adoption of any approach, the process must be made as simple as possible, and it must yield tangible rewards, such as substantial savings in developer time. We will provide hands-on training for all interested researchers, and we invite all database and tool developers to join our collective effort.
