# Highlights

PhoP-mediated LPS modifications occur in only a subset of
bacteria during infection

Probing the responses of individual macrophages to invading Salmonella, we find that variation
between individual infected host cells is determined
by the heterogeneous activity of bacterial factors
in individual infecting bacteria. W

Single-cell profiles clearly distinguished cells with different
phenotypic states. We used a list of 535 genes that are upregulated in exposed macrophages in our single-cell libraries

There is accumulating evidence that cell-to-cell variation exists in the expression of numerous bacterial factors in addition
to LPS, including other PAMPs and virulence factors. F
