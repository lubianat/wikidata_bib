Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain

  [@wikidata:Q33926910]  

# Highlights
. Cytoarchitectural differences between human and mouse have molecular correlates, including species differences in gene expression in subplate, although surprisingly we find minimal differences between the inner and outer subventricular zones even though the outer zone is expanded in humans

methods for selective analysis of discrete structural nuclei and layers25
. These data are freely accessible as part ofthe BrainSpan Atlas
of the Developing Human Brain (http://brainspan.org) via the Allen Brain Atlas data portal (http://www.brain-map.org).


The entire left hemisphere ofeach specimen was coronally, serially cryosectioned onto polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) membrane slides for laser microdissection (LMD), with interleaved slides for histological staining (Nissl, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and in situ hybridization for GAP43) for detailed structure identification

The Cajal-Retzius cell marker CALB2 (ref. 30) showed enrichment in the marginal zone and subpial granular zone as expected.

whereas mouse Zic1 is expressed by virtually all Cajal-Retzius neurons, our results indicate that this is not true inhuman as ZIC1andCALB2expression donot overlap in the marginal zone (Figs 1b and 2e).

Gene networks discriminate fetal cell types

# Comments

Little cell-type based modelling. Results were mostly expressed considering the brain regions involved.
