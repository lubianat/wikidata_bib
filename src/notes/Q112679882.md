The glycoconjugate ontology (GlycoCoO) for standardizing the annotation of glycoconjugate data and its application 

o support the above, we have developed the GlycoConjugate Ontology (GlycoCoO) as a standard semantic framework to describe and represent glycoproteomics data. GlycoCoO can be used to represent glycoproteomics data in triplestores and can serve as a basis for data exchange formats. The ontology, database providers and supporting documentation are available online (https://github.com/glycoinfo/GlycoCoO).

Over the last few decades several initiatives have cataloged and organized glycan-related information in databases. These activities started with CarbBank a database project for glycan structures which was initiated in 1987 but ceased operation in 1997 due to lack of funding support (Doubet and Albersheim 1992)

Albeit there is a bottleneck where designing the most appropriate queries may be difficult, many solutions are being developed to allow users to use natural language that can be translated to SPARQL (Ferré 2016; Damljanovic et al. 2012; Song et al. 2019; McCarthy et al. 2012; Barrière 2016; Chiba and Uchiyama 2017).

Here we present a glycoconjugate ontology, named GlycoCoO, for describing glycoconjugate structures and their functions

This collection includes several large-scale glycoproteomics studies that span 3,300 human N- and O-glycopeptides. It also makes references to biological context using Uberon (Mungall et al. 2012), Cell Ontology (Diehl et al. 2016), Gene Ontology (Gene Ontology Consortium 2015), Cellosaurus (Bairoch 2018) and Disease Ontology. The GlyConnect SPARQL endpoint (https://glyconnect.expasy.org/rdf) is being prepared and will be release by the end of 2019 
<!-- SPARQL endpoint is up and running! -->

The RDF endpoint is reachable at : https://glyconnect.expasy.org/sparql

The data model is based on the GLYCO COnjugate Ontology and data is licenced under CC BY 4.0

No user interface is yet ready to send Sparql query to the endpoint, but it will be available early 2021.

It is available in BioPortal at https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/GLYCOCOO as well as on GitHub https://github.com/glycoinfo/GlycoCoO where the Wiki page illustrates examples of usage and provides the RDF data described in this manuscript.
