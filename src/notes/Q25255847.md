# Highlights

Ligand-gated ion channels form transmembrane ionic pores controlled by the binding of chemicals. The LGICdb aims to be a non-redundant, manually curated resource offering access to the large number of subunits composing extracellularly activated ligand-gated ion channels, such as nicotinic, ATP, GABA and glutamate ionotropic receptors. 

Many of the subunits from the three superfamilies possess multiple isoforms, generated by alternative splicing or editing. The Ligand-Gated Ion Channel database (LGICdb) was created in the mid-1990s, as a repository offering a unique entry per gene (12). All the data are manually curated, in order to reduce redundancy and correct the errors coming from sequencing or introduced by automated methods of data mining (such as gene prediction).
