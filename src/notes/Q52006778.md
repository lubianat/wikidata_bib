# Highlights
We present an interactive literature based biomedical discovery support system (BITOLA). 

To make the system more suitable for disease candidate gene discovery and to decrease the number of candidate relations, we integrate background knowledge about the chromosomal location of the starting disease as well as the chromosomal location of the candidate genes from resources such as LocusLink, HUGO and OMIM.
