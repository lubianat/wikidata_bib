# Highlights
We introduce a microfluidic platform that enables off-chip single-cell RNA-seq after
multi-generational lineage tracking under controlled culture conditions. We use this platform
to generate whole-transcriptome profiles of primary, activated murine CD8 Ã¾ T-cell and
lymphocytic leukemia cell line lineages. H

Single-cell release. In contrast to previous approaches, our fluidic
design enables the retrieval of single cells after multiple
generations of proliferation for downstream assays, thereby
allowing single-cell transcriptomic data to be linked to lineage,
proliferation kinetics and live-cell image data.

 Single cells were
cultured for two generations on-chip before release for
sequencing. This allowed us to define sister and cousin cell pairs
for each lineage (Fig. 1c). T
