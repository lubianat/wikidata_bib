# Highlights

Based on emerging evidences suggesting that disease-associated SNPs are frequentlyfound within cell type-specific regulatory sequences, here we present GARLIC (GWAS-based Prediction Toolkit for ConnectingDiseases and Cell Types), a user-friendly, multi-purpose software with an associated database and online viewer that, usingglobal maps ofcis-regulatory elements, can aetiologically connect human diseases with relevant cell types.

However,  the  initial  excitement  regarding  GWAS  wassomewhat  dampened  by  the  recurrent  observation  that  most(70–90%) disease-associated genetic variation lie outside genes,within the vast non-coding fraction of the human genome (5,6).Consequently, the molecular and pathological consequences ofmany of the uncovered genetic variants remain unknown (7–9).

In  theory,  the  combination  of  GWAS  information  and  CREmaps  from   different   human   cell   types   and   tissues  shouldstreamline  the  identification  of  causative  genetic  variants  forcommon complex diseases (8,17,18).

A central component of GARLIC is a local database (DB) designedto  store  and  combine  different  data  sets:  (i)  SNPs  reported  inGWAS as associated with a list of 1049 different diseases (LeadSNPs (L-SNPs), total¼13707) and those SNPs that are in high LD(r2>0.8) with the L-SNPs (Follower SNPs (F-SNPs, total¼218663),resulting  in  a  total  of  232370  SNPs;  (ii)  CRE  maps  generated  byDNase-seq in 77 different human cell types and tissues (from theENCODE 

On the other hand, to illustrate the performance of GARLICwhen focusing on particular diseases, results for four commoncomplex diseases (i.e.coronary artery disease or large artery stroke,Type I diabetes,Parkinson’s diseaseandatrial fibrillation) are shown in Figure 2B.
