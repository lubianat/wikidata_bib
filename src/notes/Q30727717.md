# Highlights

We present here eVOC, a system which associates labelled target cDNAs for microarray
experiments, or cDNA libraries and their associated transcripts with controlled terms in a set of hierarchical
vocabularies. eVOC consists of four orthogonal controlled vocabularies suitable for describing the domains of
human gene expression data including Anatomical System, Cell Type, Pathology and Developmental Stage.

The Cell Type ontology provides a
fine-grained description of where a
gene is expressed. It is a listing of
human cell types extracted from
Grayâ€™s Anatomy (Gray et al. 1995).
The Cell Type ontology includes 153 different cell types.
