Zika virus: designate standardized names
========================================
  
  [@wikidata:Q24247056]  

# Highlights

A standard strain- naming convention for Zika virus sequences is therefore urgently needed. This will ensure that the exchange and interpretation of data is unambiguous in efforts to contain the current outbreak in the tropical Western Hemisphere.

Building on conventions in other viral fields, we urge the Zika community to adopt a standard nomenclature for isolate names, specifying the virus type (ZIKV), host species abbreviation, geographical location of isolation, unique identification string and year of isolation. The preferred isolate name for BeH818995, for example, would then be ZIKV/H. sapiens/Brazil/ BeH818995/2015.
