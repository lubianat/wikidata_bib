# Highlights

In this work, we report GNormPlus: an end-to-end and open source system that handles both gene mention and identifier detection

Closely related concepts useful for gene name disambiguation, such as gene families and protein domains.

GNormPlus compares favorably to on the BioCreative II Gene Normalization task dataset and on the BioCreative III Gene Normalization task dataset

the same gene is often described in multiple different ways:
orthographical variation (e.g., “ESR1” and “ESR-1”), morphological variation (e.g., “GHF-1 transcriptional factor” and “GHF-1 transcrip- tion factor”), variation with abbreviation (e.g., “estrogen receptor alpha (ER??)”), and composition mentions (e.g., “BRCA1/2” and “SMADs 1, 5, and 8”)

We build a new end-to-end system that includes both GM and GN modules, together with several advanced BioNLP tools (e.g., GenNorm[19], SimConcept [41], SR4GN [42], and Ab3P [43]) for improved performance.

Our proposed approach includes two main steps: mention recognition and concept normalization, respectively.

Some gene mentions (e.g., TGF-beta) are particularly confusing when they refer to genes in some articles but to family/domain in other articles.

# Comments

Uses the term BioNLP.

Lots of technical information on the algorithm. Builds upon many other algorithms, especially tmVar and SimConcept.
