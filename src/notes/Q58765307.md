# Highlights
s into non-epithelial (n = 244) and epithelial
(n = 868) types. A subset of TNBCs are known to exhibit sub-
stantial immune cell inﬁltration, and as anticipated, CD45-
unselected tumors contained large proportions of immune cells,
the majority of which were T lymphocytes 15,16 . The next most
prevalent immune cell subset were macrophages, which were
present in each CD45-unselected tumor. Like immune cells,
stromal elements are known to vary between TNBC cases 17 , and
we identiﬁed such cells as <15% of total cells in each tumor.
