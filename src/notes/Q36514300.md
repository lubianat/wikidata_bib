# Highlights

An updated list of cell types is presented for a familiar, albeit overlooked model taxon, adult Homo sapiens, with 411 cell types, including 145 types of neurons, recognised.


The artificial classification provides compelling (and independent) support for the neural crest as the fourth germ layer, while the cladistic approach permits the evaluation of cell type evolution. 


Whereas no
two cells are identical in appearance, generalized patterns of
morphology and biochemistry suggest that all cells conform
to a relatively limited number of patterns (Willmer, 1970;
Alberts et al., 1989 ; Valentine, 2003 ; see also Tyner, 1975;
Rowe & Stone, 1977 ; Rodieck & Brening, 1983). These
limited patterns of diversity are referred to as cell types.

<!-- Interesting for   - 2.4 The concept of "cell type"  -->

Along with other mutable biological units such as genes
and species, cell types exist in nature but remain notoriously
diﬃcult to deﬁne precisely and unambiguously (Valentine,
2002, 2003). Consequently, consensus on how many cell
types exist in multicellular organisms such as humans
remains unclear.


In an operational sense cell types, like species, are gener-
ally treated as numerically restricted entities. While most
authorities (e.g. Alberts et al., 1989; Valentine, 2002, 2003)
acknowledge that some degree of variation exists between
any two members of the same cell type, there is a consensus
that cell type morphology, cytoanatomy, molecular biology,
and biochemistry are not inﬁnite.

Furthermore, cell type identity
is complicated by unusual cells that share features with
two or more routinely encountered cells. For example, the
myoﬁbroblast is a ﬁbroblast-like cell found at sites of wound
healing that expresses a-actin otherwise typical of smooth
muscle cells. Finally, cells and cell types evolve (Fedak et al.,
2002; Arendt, 2003; see below). Consequently, acceptance
of a cell as an identiﬁable kind is often at the discretion (and
opinion) of the author (Bell & Mooers, 1997). As stated
by Rodieck & Brening (1983, p. 121) ‘ [d]iscovery [of cell
types] is often a creative act ’

(1) All cells under consideration should be at the same
stage of the cell cycle (gap phase 1, synthesis phase, gap
phase 2, or mitosis). During the cell cycle there are con-
siderable diﬀerences in the amounts of protein, RNA and
DNA synthesised, and overall cell morphology and size are
subject to change (Alberts et al., 1989). With few exceptions
(e.g. osteoclasts), most cells ultimately enter senescence
and die.

(2) All cells under consideration should be at the same
stage of ontogeny or maturation. Cells have limited life
spans and may demonstrate some morphological diﬀerences
throughout their existence. Cells representing stem or un-
diﬀerentiated states, by deﬁnition, should not be considered
or included as discrete cell types. Such progenitor or tran-
sitional states are subsumed into the listing as constituent
members of diﬀerentiated cell type lineages.

(3) If cells are to be compared between individuals, the
chronological age of each participant should be congruent.
To these caveats the following additions should be added :

(4) All cells under consideration should be obtained from
in vivo, not in vitro, sources. Many cells change both their
morphology and their biochemical products considerably
if maintained in culture. Chondrocytes placed in culture
lose their rounded appearance, stop producing type II
collagen, and come to resemble ﬂattened ﬁbroblasts ; ulti-
mately they begin to produce type I collagen (Alberts
et al., 1989; see also Nelander, Mostad & Lindahl, 2003).

(5) If cells are to be compared between individuals, then
the sex of each participant may need to be considered. In
sexually reproducing organisms there are obvious diﬀer-
ences in both the cells supporting the gametes (within the
reproductive organs) and in the gametes themselves, as well
as cells that are sex-hormone dependent.


Schwann proposed a ﬁve-group classi-
ﬁcation scheme for tissue types that eﬀectively established
our modern view of cell categorisation. His categories
included isolated/independent cells (blood and lymph),
independent cells in combination (epithelium), cells welded
by intercellular substance (bone, enamel), ﬁbre cells (tendon,
loose connective tissue), and cells whose walls have broken
down and whose cavities have run together (muscles, blood
vessels, nerves)

For example,
the ultrastructural atlas of human cells by Lentz (1971)
identiﬁes 178 diﬀerent cell types grouped under 15 headings
related to function, organ system, and/or tissue type. A
more recent assessment of human cell type categorisation
is found in Alberts et al. (1989) who presented a tabulated
list of 210 human cell types subdivided into 20 categories
(see also Freitas, 1999). As with Lentz (1971) and Stevens
& Lowe (1997), the categories used by Alberts et al. mostly
relate to function.

<!-- Nice! Must read these; stuff for the last year of PhD / Thesis writing -->

Drawing on the notion that cell
types represent (by deﬁnition) (terminally) diﬀerentiated
states (i.e. end points), and that ultimately all cell types are
derived from a single source, the zygote, useful analogies
may be derived from a comparison between the diversity of
cell types and the diversity of organisms (Tyner, 1975 ; Rowe
& Stone, 1977 ; Rodieck & Brening, 1983; Maclean &
Hall, 1987). Biological systematists and taxonomists have
experience in developing, testing and adapting classiﬁcation
schemes for large data sets. Whereas cell types form tissues,
organs, and organ systems, groups of species form popu-
lations, communities, and ecosystems. As such, the analogy
between cell types and organisms is not only convenient
but practical.

 The updated registry of human cell types presented herein
(Appendix 1) was created by consulting a variety of sources
from the literature, including Lentz (1971), Solcia et al.
(1987), Alberts et al. (1989), Anderson (1989), Campbell et al.
(1989), Matthews (1989), Yelnik et al. (1991), Kolb, Lindberg
& Fisher (1992), Dacey (1994), Mugnaini & Floris (1994),
Ostapoﬀ, Feng & Morest (1994), Kiernan (1998), Caterina
& Julius (1999), Sanders et al. (1999), Canning & Fischer
(2001), Cant & Benson (2003), Somogyi & Klausberger
(2005), and Yáňez et al. (2005). The catalogue was initially
assembled assuming that all cell types recognised in the
literature are natural entities (i.e. exist independent of
investigation and investigator ; Rodieck & Brening, 1983).
In addition, this rationale draws attention to even poorly
known and weakly supported cell types, with the expectation
that future investigations will provide more deﬁnitive evi-
dence supporting (or refuting) such claims (see also Rodieck
& Brening, 1983).


Owing to
the availability of data, strictly speaking some of these cells
(e.g. sympathetic neurons) may represent groups and not
necessarily a single cell type. In addition, for other cells
immature members of the lineage were included in the
scoring (e.g. for some characters features of osteoblasts were
scored for osteocytes).

total of 34 terminal artiﬁcial classiﬁcation categories
(designated A to HH) were obtained, as nested subsets of
the original fourfold polychotomy. The resulting artiﬁcial
classiﬁcation scheme is presented in Fig. 1. Appendix 1
provides a detailed summary of all cell types included in
each artiﬁcially derived category, as well as the germ layer
of origin
