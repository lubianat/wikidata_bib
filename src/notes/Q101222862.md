# Highlights

For each tool, we briefly describe its use case and how it advances research specifically for SARS-CoV-2. All tools are free to use and available online, either through web applications or public code repositories. 

oward this end, VirHostNet [30] was upgraded in March 2020 to include a comprehensive collection of protein-protein interactions manually annotated from the literature involving ORFeomes from multiple coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. This biocuration effort also incorporated, in close to real-time, the data obtained through affinity-purification mass spectrometry by the Korgan laboratory [26]. Hence, in a few days, more than 650 binary protein-protein interactions were made available to scientists working on COVID-19.

Bioinformatics tools accelerating SARS-CoV-2 research. Overview of all workflows and tools covered in this review. All tools are free to use and available online. A list of these and further tools can be found on the website of the European Virus Bioinformatics Center (EVBC): http://evbc.uni-jena.de/tools/coronavirus-tools/.

The Coronavirus Rfam families are available freely available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licence at https://rfam.org/covid-19.

--> Nice! And they even integrate with Wikipedia!


The Pfam HMM library can be downloaded from https://pfam.xfam.org and can be used in combination with pfam_scan to perform Pfam analysis locally. Multiple sequence alignments of matches can be generated using hmmalign (http://hmmer.org/). Precalculated matches and alignments are available from the Pfam FTP site (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/releases/Pfam_SARS-CoV-2_2.0/). Pfam is freely available under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) licence.

CORDITE automatically incorporates publications from PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/), chemRxiv https://www.chemrxiv.org/) and medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/) that report information on computational, in vitro, or case studies on potential drugs for COVID-19. Besides original research, reviews and comments are also included in the database.

One major bottleneck hindering high software standards is the limited capacity of scientists to build versatile software, rather than prototypes. This might be improved by merging projects with similar or overlapping goals. However, this requires a central overview of newly developed tools and ongoing research projects and of how (future) products may fit together, e.g. in the form of a processing pipeline. Unfortunately, the life cycle of software in research is relatively short. Usually, scientific funding does not include the continuous maintenance of tools and pipelines so that developers are forced to move on to other projects and research grants.
