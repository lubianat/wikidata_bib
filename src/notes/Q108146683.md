# Highlights

To generate better representations of biological knowledge, we propose STonKGs, a Sophisticated
Transformer trained on biomedical text and Knowledge Graphs (KGs). This multimodal Transformer uses combined
input sequences of structured information from KGs and unstructured text data from biomedical literature to learn
joint representations in a shared embedding space.

For instance, Federico and Monti (2021) demonstrated how to gain
insights on specific human cell-line processes by annotating proteinâ€“
protein interaction networks with contextualized cell-line informa-
tion extracted from the scientific literature. Similarly, a recent study
from Doncheva et al. (2021) introduced a methodology that pro-
poses the most suitable organism to model a human pathway by
evaluating whether the expression of genes in a certain pathway
across four species (i.e. rat, mouse, pig and humans) is maintained in
the same tissue.
