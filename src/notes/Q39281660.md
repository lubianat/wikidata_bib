# Highlights

Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) functionally resemble T lymphocytes
in cytotoxicity and cytokine production but lack antigen-specific
receptors, and they are important regulators of immune responses
and tissue homeostasis

 Here, using single-cell
RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) of mouse bone marrow progenitors,
we reveal ILC precursor subsets, delineate distinct ILC development
stages and pathways, and report that high expression of programmed
death 1 (PD-1hi) marked a committed ILC progenitor that was
essentially identical to an innate lymphoid cell progenitor

scRNA-seq of bone marrow ILCs thus enabled identification of
distinct ILC progenitor subsets, delineation of ILC development, and
discovery of PD-1 as a marker of innate lymphoid progenitors and
effector ILCs
