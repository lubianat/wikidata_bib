# Highlights
The Gene Transcription Regulation Database (GTRD; http://gtrd.biouml.org/) contains uniformly annotated and processed NGS data related to gene transcription regulation: ChIP-seq, ChIP-exo, DNase-seq, MNase-seq, ATAC-seq and RNA-seq.

GTRD provides an integrated view of transcription regulation through a dedicated web interface with advanced browsing and search capabilities, an integrated genome browser, and table reports by cell types, transcription factors, and genes of interest.

In pursuing this goal, we started developing the Gene Transcription Regulation Database (GTRD) in 2011.

 Whenever possible, all entries were linked with the existing cell type dictionaries and ontologies: UBERON (23), Cell Ontology (24), BRENDA tissue ontology (25), Plant Ontology (26), and Cellosaurus (27).
