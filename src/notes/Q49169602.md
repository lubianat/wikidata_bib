# Highlights

In ourmodel, knee-joint OA was induced in male Wistar rats byintra-articular sodium monoiodoacetate (MIA) injections.Whole-genome microarrays were used to analyse the alter-ations in gene expression during the time-course of OA devel-opment (at 2, 14, and 28 days post-injection) in rat knee joints.

Male Wistar rats (Charles River, Germany) initially weighingbetween 225 and 250 g were used for all the experiments

 A list of genes from each geneexpression pattern was analysed by the Wiki Pathways 2015categories (Fig.2b). The group of genes in pattern A wasenriched with factors involved in PPAR signalling (e.g.,AdipoqandAqp7) and adipogenesis (e.g.,CfdandLipe).Among the genes in pattern B, transcripts connected withWNT signalling (e.g.,Fzd8andPrkca) and focal adhesion(e.g.,Itga8andItgb8) were over-represente

 We further investigated whether the alterations in gene expres-sion were associated with particular cell types (Fig.3c).Identification of the types of cells expressing genes in clustersAâ€“E was carried out in reference to the Mouse Gene Atlas
which catalogues the cellular enrichment of individual tran-scripts in various cells and tissues.
