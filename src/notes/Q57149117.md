# Highlights
To that end, we have begun a pipeline project using multipatch electrophysiology, supplemented with two-photon optogenetics, to characterize connectivity and synaptic signaling between classes of neurons in adult mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and human cortex.

About half of the cell types in the brain are excitatory, which means they can activate other cells. The cortex consists of several distinct layers of cells, within which excitatory cells cooperate to process the signals they receive from other cortical layers and brain areas. Using recordings of electrical activity arising from the connections between pairs of excitatory neurons, Seeman, Campagnola et al. measured the likelihood and strength of connectivity among related groups of excitatory cell types in slices of cortex taken from human and mouse brains.

Although it may be possible to infer part of these results based solely on anatomical constraints (Markram et al., 2015), evidence has shown that the rate of connectivity and properties of synaptic signals can depend on the identity of the pre- and postsynaptic neuron

. Initially, we seek to characterize connectivity among cell classes, that is, groups of related cell types (Tasic et al., 2016). 
These cell types are generated from
narrow microdomains patterned by the Nkx6.2 and Zic family of transcription factors (TFs),
suggesting a functional role for these TFs in adult neurogenesis.


We discovered new progenitor domains in
the lateral ventricle that produce four previously unknown subtypes of postnatally-born OB interneurons


Type 1 cells resembled GCs, but were clearly distinct from previously characterized G I , G II ,
or G III cells 19

the dendrites of Type 1 cells frequently failed to reach beyond the internal
plexiform layer (IPL)

ased on their
distinctive shrub-like dendritic arbors, we call Type 2 cells shrub granule cells (G V )
