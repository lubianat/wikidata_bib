# Highlights
We profile the transcriptomes of over 100,000 human single cells, yielding molecular definitions for non-parenchymal cell types present in healthy and cirrhotic human liver

. Leucocytes (CD45+) or other NPC (CD45-) fractions (Extended Data Fig. 1b) were FACS-sorted prior to scRNA-seq

Liver-resident cells expressed higher levels of tissue-residency markers such as CXCR4 compared to PBMC (Extended Data Fig. 1f)

We proceeded to annotate all human liver NPC lineages (below, Supplementary Notes 1-3, Extended Data Fig. 3), and provide an open-access gene browser (http://www.livercellatlas.mvm.ed.ac.uk) 


Scar-associated clusters SAMΦ(1) and SAMΦ(2) expressed the unique markers TREM2 and CD9 (Fig. 2d, e). These macrophages displayed a hybrid phenotype, with features of both tissue monocytes and KC (Fig. 2d, e), analogous to monocyte-derived macrophages in murine liver injury models

Conditioned media from FACS-sorted SAMΦ promoted fibrillar collagen expression by primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) (Fig. 2g), indicating that SAMΦ have a pro-fibrogenic phenotype. Tissue staining demonstrated the presence of TREM2+CD9+MNDA+ SAMΦ topographically localised in collagen-positive scar regions (Fig. 2h, Extended Data Fig. 4g-i), 


To further characterise SAMΦ phenotype, we identified differentially expressed genes along monocyte differentiation trajectories. We defined three gene co-expression modules, with module 1 representing upregulated genes during blood monocyte-to-SAMΦ differentiation (Fig. 3c). Module 1 contained multiple pro-fibrogenic genes including SPP1, LGALS3, CCL2, CXCL8, PDGFB and VEGFA10–13, and displayed ontology terms consistent with promoting tissue fibrosis and angiogenesis (Fig. 3c, d; Supplementary Table 10)

--> Use of coexpression, maybe interesting for 0.1 fcoex & FCBF
 

This demonstrated SAMΦ expansion in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (Extended Data Fig. 7a, b), an increased frequency of SAMΦ with worsening histological NASH activity (NAS) and fibrosis scores (Extended Data Fig. 7c)


Disease-specific endothelial cells Endo(6) and Endo(7), CD34+PLVAP+VWA1+ and CD34+PLVAP+ACKR1+ respectively (Fig. 4a-c, Extended Data Fig. 8b), expanded in cirrhotic liver tissu
