# Highlights
LAMP1+TRAIL+ astrocytes limit inflammation in the CNS by inducing T cell apoptosis through TRAIL–DR5 signalling. In homeostatic conditions, the expression of TRAIL in astrocytes is driven by interferon-γ (IFNγ) produced by meningeal natural killer (NK) cells, in which IFNγ expression is modulated by the gut microbiome. 

ere we describe a subset of astrocytes that is driven by IFNγ produced by meningeal NK cells, and show that IFNγ expression in these NK cells is modu-lated by the commensal flora. This subpopulation of astrocytes limits inflammation in the CNS by inducing TRAIL-dependent apoptosis in pro-inflammatory T cells

e. The most abundant marker expressed by spinal cord astrocytes was lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1; also known as CD107a)2, which was upregulated during EAE in spinal cord astrocytes, but not in cer-ebellar, cortical or parenchymal (subcortical) astrocytes (Fig. 1d–g, Extended Data Fig. 2a–c)
