# Highlights
Here, we report analysis by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) combined with comprehensive histological analyses to characterize intracerebral grafts from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and fetal tissue after functional maturation in a pre-clinical rat PD model. We show that neurons and astrocytes are major components in both fetal and stem cell-derived grafts.

a t-SNE showing clustering of 746 cells grafted to striatum (683 cells of hESC origin, grafted rats n = 2; 63 cells of fetal origin, grafted rats n = 2). Cell type assignments are indicated: OL oligodendrocyte, N Neuron, AC astrocyte, VLMC vascular leptomeningeal cells.

Vascular leptomeningeal cells are a previously unknown component in hESC-derived grafts

When this dataset was searched for cell types co-expressing enriched genes of the fourth cluster, “enteric glia” and “vascular leptomeningeal cells” (VLMCs) were identified as cell type categories with highly related gene expression profiles (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c).
