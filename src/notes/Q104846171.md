# Highlights

This manuscript proposes a general approach for
querying a causal biological knowledge graph, and converting
the qualitative result into a quantitative structural causal model
that can learn from data to answer the question.

We argue that counterfactual inference [5] helps bridge the gap
between data-driven and hypothesis-driven approaches. It enables
questions of the form: “Had we known the eventual outcome of
a patient, what would we have done differently?” At the heart of
counterfactual inference is a formalism known as a structural causal
model (SCM) [5], [6]. It represents prior domain knowledge in terms
of causal diagrams, assumes a probability distribution on exogenous
variables, and assigns a deterministic function to endogenous variables.
SCM are particularly attractive in systems biology, where structured
domain knowledge is extracted from the biomedical literature and is
readily available through advances in natural language processing [7],
[8], [9],

This manuscript contributes a three-part algorithm that leverages
existing structured biological knowledge to answer counterfactual
questions about viral pathogenesis.


In contrast, the Biological Expression Language (BEL) [20] was
specifically designed for manual extraction and automated integration
of author statements about causal relationships among biological entities, biological processes, and cellular-level observable phenomena [11].


Given a biological knowledge graph K and a causal query of interest
Q, our first objective is to generate a qualitative causal model B
capable of answering the query.
