# Highlights
For example, organoids allow genetic and pharmaco‐logical manipulation in a complex cellular context that reflects human biology, and they make it possible to investigate the early stages of organ development and disease onset, which are hard to study in vivo

 Moreover, we are still learn‐ing how to use organoids most effectively for discovering novel biology (e.g., through genetic and pharma‐cological perturbations) and how to exploit them for drug development and personalized medicine. 

 o help deliver on the promises of combining human organoids with single‐cell technology, we have launched an Organoid Cell Atlas pilot project, as a ‘Biological Network’ within the Human Cell Atlas (HCA)4

 The EU H2020 HCA|Organoid project enables us to establish a first version of the Organoid Cell Atlas over the coming years, which may act as a nucleus for a broader, collaborative, global initiative.
