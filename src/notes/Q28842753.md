# Highlights

Here we present BridgeDb, a software framework for gene, protein and metabolite identifier mapping.

By uncoupling bioinformatics tools from mapping services, BridgeDb improves capability and flexibility of those tools. All described software is open source and available at http://www.bridgedb.org.
--> Site is on! And part of the ELIXIR infrastructure.

More often than not, data of different types and from different sources are annotated with different identifiers. Thus, an important step in the analysis workflow is deducing which identifiers from one set correspond to which identifiers in the other set.

BridgeDb is a software library intended to be used by bioinformatics tool developers.

We use the term data source to describe a database of biological entities, indexed by unique identifiers.

A global identifier is a globally unique identifier based o nthe combinationofdata sourceand internal identifier. 

BridgeDb relies on the MIRIAM URI standard [12]. MIRIAM describes a minimal set of information to define a biological model and requires that biological identifiers be sufficiently descriptive. A valid MIRIAM URI contains both the data source and internal identifier (e.g., urn:miriam:uniprot:P62158)

Broadly speaking, BridgeDb can be useful whenever an application needs to make use of multiple mapping ser- vices or wants to enable the user to choose among different services.
