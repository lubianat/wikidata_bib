# Highlights

STARsolo can replicate the results of, but is considerably faster than CellRanger, currently the most widely used tool for pre-processing scRNA-seq data. In addition to uniquely mapped reads, STARsolo takes account of multi-gene reads, necessary to detect certain classes of biologically important genes. It has a flexible cell barcode processing scheme, compatible with many established scRNA-seq protocols, and extendable to emerging technologies.

xing), and (iv) counting the number of unique RNA molecules (UMI deduplication). The outcome of this procedure
is the gene/cell expression matrix, which contains the counts of RNA molecules in
each cell for each gene. The mapping/quantification accuracy is of the utmost importance, since it serves as the starting point for all the downstream analyses. This
procedure is also computationally demanding, as it requires processing hundreds of
millions of reads generated in a typical scRNA-seq experiment.
